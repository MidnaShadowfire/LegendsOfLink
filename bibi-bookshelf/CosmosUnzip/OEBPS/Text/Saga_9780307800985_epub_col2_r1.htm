<p class="nonindent">“The past year&#160;…&#160;saw that extraordinary television series, <em>Cosmos</em>, on the Public Broadcasting Service; these programs initiated tens of millions of viewers not only into the wonders of space but also into awareness of the deepest scientific questions concerning the nature and origin of the world, of life, of humankind. Carl Sagan’s book <em>Cosmos</em> is not the script of the television series but rather a full-fledged account, mostly in chronological order, of the great human efforts at scientific accomplishment. <em>Cosmos</em> gives the reader the opportunity to explore in depth.… will make the writings of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells seem prosaic.”</p>

<p class="nonindent">“In just a few years, Sagan&#160;…&#160;has become Mr. Science, a widely respected popularizer able to link the stuff and history of life with the vastness of space and eternity. And he does it with a grace and élan that persuades you, for the moment at least, that nothing is more exciting or more important,”</p>
<p class="right"><em>Chicago Tribune</em></p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="nonindent">“Sagan is an astronomer with one eye on the stars, another on history, and a third—his mind’s—on the human condition.… We admire him greatly for his ambition and erudition, occasionally for the grace of his prose, and often for amazing us about our universe and ourselves.”</p>
<p class="right"><em>Newsday</em></p>

<div class="block">
<p class="nonindent">“A fine work of popular science, with an unusual dose of imagination and vision.”</p>
<p class="right"><em>The San Diego Union</em></p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="nonindent">“Sagan knows precisely how to excite the imagination of the lay reader and hold his interest from first page to last.… Here is this mind-stretching book to take us on the most fascinating of all voyages, knowledgeable, beautifully written, and strikingly illustrated. Every intelligent reader should read, mark, learn and inwardly digest Sagan’s cosmic story.”</p>
<p class="right"><em>John Barkham Reviews</em></p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="nonindent">“Magnificent&#160;…&#160;Sagan’s inquiry into man within nature is free from superstition and pessimism.… A grand vision.”</p>
