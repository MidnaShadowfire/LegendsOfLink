      <span class="c14">Countdown</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I reached the bottom of the stairwell to see Tatl entertaining herself by flipping through some open picture books. Relief shone through her features when she saw I was unharmed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"See? You're ok! Although... honestly I admit that I didn't know if the astronomer had been affected by Skull Kid's magic, but there was nothing to worry about after all!" Tatl twinkled. "Soooo... did you find where the Skull Kid is hiding?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Oh, well thanks for that!" I sarcastically replied. "And yeah I did. He's controlling the moon from the top of the Clock Tower in town."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl huffed in frustration and kicked the book she had been studying shut, a soft thud echoing throughout the small room. "Of course he is! Why didn't I think of that?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I looked at the pixie in confusion. "What do you mean? Are you saying that we could have skipped this whole mess of a journey? I crawled through a sewer to get here!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Look, I wasn't thinking straight, I'm sorry! I don't like to ruminate about stuff like that, ok!?" Tatl snapped back, but there was a flicker of pain behind her words, like a flame shrinking inward.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"What do you mean? Stuff like what?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I just...!" Tatl paused and softened her voice. "I just don't like to think about the past. That junk simply distracts from the present..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">We stood in silence. The flickering torchlight painted long shadows across the walls, and for a moment, it felt like the room was holding its breath with us. I understood her hesitation. The past was a wound I carried too—one that had never quite closed. Horrific struggles, torn friendships, betrayals that still echoed in my chest. A different world. A different me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I know what you mean," I said, voice quieter now. "The past is also hard for me to talk about… It hasn't been an easy life for me, even before all of this nonsense."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I knelt beside her, folding my legs underneath me, and looked up into her glowing form, haloed in the soft, golden light from the bookshelves nearby. "But if you ever </span>
      <span class="c16">do</span>
      <span class="c8"> want to talk about it, I'm here. You don’t have to carry all that alone. Not anymore."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl hovered there for a long moment, her wings beating slowly, the quiet hum sounding almost like a heartbeat in the stillness. Then, with hesitant grace, she drifted forward and gently rested herself against my shoulder. Her glow softened, no longer sharp and flickering, but calm—like a firelight remembering how to be warm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Same goes for you, dummy," she murmured. Her voice was quieter than I'd ever heard it. "You don’t have to keep pretending you're made of stone. I see you. You know... even when you try to hide it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Something in her words broke through the last of my armor. I let out a small breath, one I hadn’t realized I was holding, and closed my eyes for a moment. A fragile understanding passed between us—not made of grand declarations, but of quiet, mutual scars that hummed in the spaces we dared not speak aloud.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The world outside was ending. The sky was falling. But in that moment, a thread was woven between two broken souls. Not because I was stronger. But because, for once, I wasn’t entirely alone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I guess... you deserve to know about it. In a way, a small part pertains to you as well..." Tatl whispered, still resting lightly on my shoulder. She took a breath that shimmered with the weight of memory, and began:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Before all the bad stuff happened, Tael, Skull Kid, and I were kind of a family. We stuck together because no one else would take us in. We were outcasts, and orphans." Tatl sighed. "On clear evenings, Tael and I would carry Skull Kid up the Clock Tower and watch the sunset over the ocean. We would all laugh, tell jokes, talk about our desires, and just have fun. When night fell, we gazed at the blanket of stars shining with the moon. I'd recite old legends and ghost stories, and we'd be up all night, too terrified or excited to sleep." Tatl paused, her glow dimming slightly with the ache of remembrance. "Those were during the good times..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Sounds to me like you were really attached to Skull Kid... what happened?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl fell quiet, her wings twitching faintly. When she finally spoke, her voice was tinged with bitterness and grief. "That stupid mask happened. As soon as Skull Kid put it on... he changed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She fiddled with her tiny hands, the motion a shield against the storm she was reliving.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Skull Kid, well, he was always kinda mischievous. He loved to play pranks on others, but his jokes rarely ever hurt people. One day, we were playing hide and seek in the forest and we were having a great time! Skull Kid was the seeker, Tael and I hid in the bushes a ways away. We'd been waiting for him for a while, when suddenly Skull Kid started calling out to us, saying that he wanted to show us something. When we reached him, we saw a man with a large pack lying unconscious in the grass. There were masks of all shapes and sizes everywhere, and there was Skull Kid, standing over the man's body... and wearing that awful horned, purple mask."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl turned to face the wall, her small body trembling. Her voice had grown thinner, and something in her shimmered like the last leaf on a tree.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"His pranks quickly became more and more violent, and he forced us to participate. Innocent bystanders suffered. We trashed towns and homes. People started to hate us. But despite all that, Tael and I stayed with him, really hoping that he would see the pain he caused and would stop. But he only grew worse the longer he wore the mask."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl sniffled, and faced me again. Her tiny eyes were still glazed over in memory, and in them I saw something raw and unhealed—the heartbreak of watching someone you love disappear inside themselves.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"It wasn't much longer before the guardian deities of this land banded together, and kicked us out of Termina. That's when he changed for the worst," she said softly, her voice laced with a sorrowful kind of reverence. "Skull Kid was filled with a terrible wrath, screaming about revenge, and how everyone would pay. His dark mask began to give him strange abilities, at the cost of his good spirit. He went through the forest we were sent to, and focused his anger and rage on every living being he came across. In his eyes, they were all his own personal playthings..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Her words hung between us like a bitter mist. The torchlight shimmered faintly in the corners of her glow, and for once, there was no sarcasm, no mockery. Only grief.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl broke her focus and turned to meet my gaze. Her wings gave the faintest flick, not out of impatience, but to keep herself grounded in the moment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"And that's when we met you. The Skull Kid saw you and your horse moving through the woods and thought it would be fun to mess with a swordsman. We followed, and... well, you know the rest..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She floated closer, so close I could feel the warmth of her light on my cheek. "Link... I'm sorry for my part. I truly didn't think it would ever go so far..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Her voice cracked just slightly. Not from guilt, but from the quiet ache of someone finally laying down a burden they'd carried too long. It was the first time I had ever heard such sincerity come from her. I was speechless, a tightness blooming in my chest, but I nodded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"It's ok, Tatl. Thank you. Thank you for telling me all of that. It couldn't have been easy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"But you understand, right?" she pleaded, drifting back an inch. "The Skull Kid isn't really evil. I'm positive that it's the mask that's causing him to be this way! We have to help him!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I looked away. The room suddenly felt colder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I don't know... All I can be certain of is that he's going to destroy the world, and I have to stop him. It might not even be possible to help him. I'm sorry."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl nodded, but there was something hollow in the gesture. Like part of her had braced for those words, and still hoped she wouldn’t hear them. She hovered silently for a moment longer, then turned abruptly and zipped toward the passageway leading back through the sewer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Well... either way. We can't do anything while we stand around here. We have to get back to town, and to the top of that tower!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Wait, why can't we just go the normal way back into town?" I asked, tilting my head. "There's a door leading right outside, up there!" I pointed up the stairs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Well yeah... but... I don't want to be spotted by that crazy old man. He could snap at the first sight of me, and then incinerate us with his horrible fire spitting blowtorch!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I waved her off with a sigh. "He's not crazy. You guys broke his stuff. I'd be angry too! And besides, the Bomber kids down there are probably awake by now. I really don't feel like explaining myself to them. Now, let's hurry outside and head back to town!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I turned and started up the stairs, the conversation still clinging to my thoughts like morning mist. Behind me, I heard Tatl grumble under her breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Urghh... fine, Miss Prissy. I'll just hide under your cloak until we're back in town."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She zipped underneath the folds of my green cloak, her deep vulnerability shuttered behind sarcasm once more. But I felt the warmth of her light settle at my shoulder, quieter than usual. And I understood.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Some things are too raw to hold in the open air for long.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I slowed as we neared the top of the stairwell and peeked around the corner to the rising platform. Reton was completely focused on his telescope, muttering quietly to himself as his robes gently rustled in the breeze from the open hatch above. I tiptoed toward the door, the wooden floorboards creaking faintly beneath my soft boots. With careful fingers, I eased the latch open and slipped outside.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I squinted against the brilliant afternoon light, my eyes watering as they adjusted after so long in the subterranean gloom. The Star Chamber crowned the peak of a low hill, encircled by tall trees whose canopies murmured with the wind. Gusts tousled my hair and swirled around my green cloak, which still shielded Tatl, grumbling, beneath its fur-lined interior. The breeze smelled of pine and damp earth, tinged faintly with the scent of something floral just beginning to bloom. Below me, the white limestone walls of Clock Town stood tall and quiet, their rough-hewn faces gleaming under the early summer sun. From here, the town looked peaceful—a gem set against the backdrop of an approaching doom.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The Clock Tower loomed in the distance, its long shadow casting a solemn swath over the town’s rooftops. Its four-sided clock face glinted quietly in the sun, unmoving, as if holding its breath. I could almost hear the echo of a bell that hadn’t yet rung. It was now one o'clock.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">After taking a moment to breathe in the eerie calm, I gauged the hill's slope. It wasn't too steep, and the grassy incline beckoned like an open invitation. With a running start, I vaulted forward, cloak streaming behind me. The hill was soft beneath my boots, each step muffled by thick blades of grass as I picked up speed. Tatl let out an indignant squeak as she was jostled about in the folds of my cloak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Oof! Could you </span>
      <span class="c16">not</span>
      <span class="c8"> treat me like a sack of beans?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I laughed, my hair whipping around me as the wind rushed past. The air tasted clean and wild, and for a brief moment, I felt free.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">With a final leap, I landed at the base of the hill among a cluster of maple and birch trees. Shadows clung to their trunks in broad, broken shapes. The rustle of leaves was joined by the chirp of unseen birds, and the distant hum of insects waking from the storm's aftermath. I took a few steadying breaths, then noticed the dirt path curving gently upward—a trail I had entirely missed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"What were you thinking? I'm stuck in your hot, stinky cloak, having a bad time, and you go jumping off cliffs when we have a perfectly good trail to walk down?" Tatl's muffled voice shot from the folds of fabric, furious and faintly wheezy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Oh stop whining, that way was faster." I smirked. "Besides, with all your little jokes about me lately, you had it coming. Why are you still in there anyway?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Well... I... but..." Tatl sputtered, clearly struggling to defend her cowardice. "Pshh! Whatever... I don't want that dumb old man to see me, who knows what else he has in his arsenal."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I chuckled and stepped onto the dirt path, brushing my hands along the wild grass lining its edge. The trees thinned out as we walked, the ground beneath my boots shifting between packed soil and slick patches of mud. Overhead, the leafy canopy became dense again, blotting out the sun and casting the grove into a cool twilight hush. Mottled pools of light danced between the leaves, catching on dewdrops and spiderwebs stretched between the branches.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The quagmire made the hike back to town a sluggish plod. My deerskin boots were great for stealth and acrobatics, but terrible for trudging through rough terrain. My feet were sucked into the clinging mud with each step, and the dirt path blended in with the bog. The slop forced me to fight to stay balanced and upright, and each pull flung the thick muck every which way. I must have looked like a street urchin, crawling through untold filth from the sewer and now this thick mud. Maybe I could get cleaned up at the Stock Pot Inn if there was time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I reached the edge of the shaded grove, winded. Finally, on sundried dirt and fields, I decided to rest. I felt Tatl bat my cloak away, and free herself from the no doubt, foul-smelling garment. The pixie gulped deep breaths of fresh air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">"Do you </span>
      <span class="c30">gasp</span>
      <span class="c23"> have any idea how bad it stinks in there!?" Tatl wheezed dramatically, fanning her face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"There's nothing I can do about it. That's just what happens when you crawl through a sewer," I muttered, flicking splatters of mud off my leather gloves. The sunlight felt like a blessing, warming the chill from my bones as I kicked clumps of muck from my boots.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Link! Watch out!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">Something deep green flashed in the corner of my eye, and I twisted aside on instinct. A wet, slapping </span>
      <span class="c30">plop</span>
      <span class="c23"> struck the ground where I had just been. I turned, unslinging my bow in one smooth motion, and aimed at the threat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">What stood before me was a man-sized glob of animate slime. Its translucent emerald form rippled with inner motion, like thick syrup barely holding shape. Two bulbous eyes jiggled at the top of its dripping mass, and inside its gelatinous body, I glimpsed the half-digested remains of some unfortunate forest rabbit. The creature pulsed forward in a twitching lurch, shaped like a grotesque teardrop made of toxic jelly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">I blinked in disbelief. "What </span>
      <span class="c30">is</span>
      <span class="c23"> that thing?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl zipped up beside me, her wings buzzing in alarm. "That's a Chuchu! Normally they're small and harmless, but lately? Everything’s going wild. These things have multiplied and grown to absurd sizes. This one’s probably been feeding off magical runoff near town."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The Chuchu quivered and lurched again, its body wobbling like a drum of acid-filled pudding.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Great," I muttered, drawing my bowstring tight. "So what, do I just shoot it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"If you want to survive, yes!" Tatl snapped. "Don’t let it touch you! That slime is super acidic while it's alive. You'll roast faster than a Deku nut in a bonfire. Wait until it's down, then back off—it turns inert when it dies."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I narrowed my eyes. "Perfect. Just the relaxing stroll I needed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The Chuchu wobbled and leapt towards me once more, making sloppy splat sounds that echoed through the clearing like wet applause. I took aim with the magic bow, drew the string back—still amazed at the radiant shaft of white light that shimmered into existence—and let the bolt fly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c17">FWAAASPLOOSH!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The creature let out a grotesque gurgle as the bolt pierced through its center, erupting into a spray of fluorescent goop. It collapsed into a glistening puddle of green sludge, twitching once before going still.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Wow... I </span>
      <span class="c16">love</span>
      <span class="c8"> this thing!" I held up the bow with a grin, turning to Tatl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She bobbed approvingly. "I'd say the Great Fairy knew exactly what she was doing. I mean, sure, Chuchus and balloons are hardly intimidating, but you’ve got real form. That shot was clean. Like you’ve been doing it for years."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I re-slung the weapon with a sense of practiced comfort. "Yeah, back in Hyrule I had a bow from a temple. It was elegant, powerful... one of my favorite weapons. I used it so much, it became instinct....like breathing or swinging a sword. Before I left, I gave it to my sworn brother Darunia and the Gorons as a parting gift."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Gorons? You mean you have those rock-eating dummies where you're from too?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I raised an eyebrow at her tone. "They're not dummies. Just... incredibly stubborn. But yeah, we had them too. I didn’t know there were Gorons in Termina."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Sure are," Tatl replied. "They live up north in the Snowhead mountains. I haven't been up there in a long time though, they're such a pain to traverse if you aren't made of stone."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">As we neared the outskirts of town, I let that revelation roll around in my head. Could it be that Termina was some kind of mirror world? Had refugees from Hyrule crossed into this realm ages ago?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">My thoughts were interrupted as the rattle of wheels and hooves clattered toward me from the dirt road. A rickety, horse-drawn cart came barreling down the path, its wheels squeaking in protest. The driver pulled hard on the reins with a shout, and the horses whinnied to a stop, kicking up a cloud of dust.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Hooo, easy now!" the man bellowed, his deep voice like gravel tumbling in a barrel. "Hey! Young lady! Over here!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I tensed slightly and walked the short distance to the cart, hand near my belt in case things turned sideways. The man who hopped down had tallow-colored hair slicked back with oil, a grin missing a few teeth, and a smell that suggested he hadn't bathed since the last lunar cycle. His patchy tan shirt had seen better decades, and his khaki trousers were more hole than fabric.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Where are you headed? You can't really be going back to town... right? Why, haven't you seen that the moon is falling right on top of it?" he asked, his voice cracking with the strain of fear. His eyes were wide, rimmed red with exhaustion and desperation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Behind him, the wagon bed was crowded with terrified families. A woman clutched a crying infant swaddled in a patchwork blanket. A boy, no older than ten, stared blankly at the sky while holding a wooden sword in trembling hands. Another man rocked back and forth, whispering a prayer under his breath. The smell of smoke drifted from the town beyond, sharp and acrid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl whispered to me, "What are you doing! We don't have time for this dummy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Yeah, I... ummm... I have family there," I said quickly, eyes fixed on the cart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The man didn't seem to believe me, but panic overrode his skepticism. He frantically beckoned for me to climb in. "Maybe so, but you should come with us! It's dangerous to go alone! Especially for a skinny little thing such as yourself. There's monsters and bad people running around EVERYWHERE! The guards abandoned the gates! The mayor's mansion is burning!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"No thank you," I said softly but firmly. "I really have to get back to town."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I turned back toward the looming walls of Clock Town. Over them, thick clouds of smoke billowed into the air like black flags. I could hear faint cries carried on the wind—calls for help, for mercy, for someone to stop the sky from falling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Hey, wait! Are you sure you don't want to come with us?" the man shouted after me, voice tinged with helplessness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Yeah, I'm positive! I'm sorry, but I have to get going!" I called back, already breaking into a jog.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Ok... I wish you and your family luck! Farewell! Be safe!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I heard the poor man scramble back onto the cart. The driver cracked the reins, and the wagon groaned forward, disappearing down the muddy path like a funeral procession fleeing from the grave.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I guess people in town are panicking. We'd better hurry and get back!" I told Tatl, and without another word, broke into a sprint.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">We made it to the southern town gates just as the sun bled into the horizon, painting the sky with streaks of crimson and gold. The massive limestone entrance loomed before us like a monument to a dying world. Time felt warped, disjointed—as though every tick of the clock hastened the moon's descent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">We entered the southern district, the slums where I'd first found the lost fairy that fateful night. Now, that same place had turned into a vision of the apocalypse. No guards patrolled the entrance. Their posts were abandoned, shields discarded like broken promises. In the distance, screams tore through the smoke-choked air—anguished, terrified, desperate. The clang of stolen swords, the crackle of burning homes, and the panicked braying of overburdened livestock filled every breath with chaos.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Townsfolk of every class scrambled through the streets, brandishing weapons or fists, clawing over wagons, doors, even each other to find some escape. A pair of noblemen fought tooth and nail over a crumbling rickshaw, their fine coats stained with soot and blood. Children wailed from alleyways as flames devoured the wooden skeletons of their homes. Horses lay shattered and screaming in the streets, many already rotting, their flanks torn by panic or worse.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">And then, impossibly, Gorons. Enraged about </span>
      <span class="c16">something</span>
      <span class="c8">, they rampaged down the boulevards, smashing buildings with massive stone hammers, their roars shaking window panes. I saw one tear the awning from a bakery and hurl it into a nearby fountain with a guttural cry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Hurry! Let's get to that Clock Tower!" Tatl cried, her voice almost lost in the din, zipping down the debris-strewn street like a trailing spark.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I sprinted after her, dodging overturned carts and sidestepping throngs of frantic citizens. I drew my bow, heart pounding, prepared for anything. My boots splashed through puddles that glistened with firelight, slick with ash and blood.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Above it all, the Clock Tower loomed like a final sentinel—monolithic, unmoved. The terrible, leering moon now filled nearly the entire sky, its cratered face swollen with fury, leering down at us like a cruel god.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I pushed myself harder, lungs burning, until we reached the great base of the tower.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">There, at the massive wooden doors, stood the mask salesman. He waved us toward him with urgency, his limbs swaying like a puppet cut free of its strings. His eyes were far too calm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"You, my young hero, have certainly waited too long to return my mask!" he said, looking me over.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"It's not my fault, I've run into a few difficulties as you can clearly see!" I snapped, gesturing bitterly to my altered form.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Yes... I can see." His voice was quieter now. "I can help return you to your true self, but you must regain that which was stolen. Only then can I help."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Right, you need your mask," Tatl said sharply.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Not only my mask, but that sacred instrument."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"You mean my Ocarina?" I frowned. "How do you know about that? It's supposed to be a Royal Family secret."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Why, I make it my business to know, yes. As I stated before, information buys happiness, and happiness is what I sell, hohoho!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">There was something terribly wrong about him—a flicker in his movements, like reality couldn't fully decide where he belonged. Power rolled off him like perfume, sweet and poisonous. But I had no choice. He was the only thread I had left.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Now, hurry young hero! The longer you wait, the more these people will suffer." He pointed to the exit with unnerving enthusiasm. "Be quick, and have faith! You shall succeed!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I turned to the door, Tatl trailing behind me with nervous sparks crackling off her wings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I really don't like that guy, he gives me the creeps!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I agree," I muttered, brushing my muddy bangs from my eyes. "But we may not like him, and we may not trust him, but he's the only one who seems to know what’s really happening."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Yeah... I guess so," Tatl said, glancing back toward the tower. "I just hope we're not making a huge mistake."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I tilted my head up toward the peak of the Clock Tower, where time itself seemed to freeze. There was no path, no staircase. Just stone, shadow, and the promise of collapse. The scaffolding left by the fleeing construction crew barely scraped a fraction of the height.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"So... how the hell am I supposed to get up there?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">We searched frantically, weaving through a landscape of chaos as screams and thunderclaps echoed around the plaza. A sickening pressure twisted through my gut and mind—like the dark tendrils from before were slithering inside me, coiling tighter with each heartbeat. There were no visible stairs up the brick tower, no open doors, no ropes, no hope.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I circled the base of the Clock Tower, my boots splashing through puddles and crunching shattered glass. At the far end, I spotted a narrow ramp leading to a crumbling ledge, barely clinging to the wall about thirteen meters off the ground. I ran a trembling hand across my temple, caked in grime and sweat, my vision flickering with panic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Ok... how do I even get to the top?" I muttered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Umm... Well, I certainly can't carry you like I did with Skull Kid! You may be lighter than you were before, but I can't possibly take you all the way up without killing myself!" Tatl snapped, though even her sarcasm trembled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I let out a groan, half-laughing in despair. "Great. I'm going to die looking like </span>
      <span class="c16">this</span>
      <span class="c8">."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Why don't you ask around? I've </span>
      <span class="c16">seen</span>
      <span class="c8"> people up there during festivals. There has to be a way!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I glanced around. The plaza, once alive with laughter and music, was now a silent grave. Ash drifted through the air like snow. Cracked stalls and abandoned confetti told the story of a celebration that would never come. Tatl must have seen the flicker of hopelessness in my eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Maybe we should return to the Stock Pot Inn? Anju might know something. Besides..." She flitted close to my tunic and wrinkled her nose. "You </span>
      <span class="c16">really</span>
      <span class="c8"> need a bath. Badly."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"We don't have time for that, Tatl!" I barked, swatting her away. The twisting in my head was getting worse—not just nausea, but something deeper, like my thoughts were warping, reshaping themselves. "The moon is falling by the minute, and I’m starting to feel sick...."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"But look around! That ledge is the only way! Even if you </span>
      <span class="c16">could</span>
      <span class="c8"> reach it, you’d never get up there fast enough!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I clenched my jaw. "Fine... I guess you're right. Let's just go."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">We reached the inn long after twilight gave way to night. The earth groaned beneath our feet in violent tremors, like the world itself was trying to shake us off. The air was thick with ash and panic, every breath laced with smoke and dread.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Clock Town had become a waking nightmare.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Fires danced along rooftops, their orange tongues licking at the heavens, casting flickering shadows over the cobbled streets. Market stalls lay in splinters, fruits and trinkets crushed underfoot. A child wailed from beneath a toppled cart, his cries barely audible over the cacophony. A stray dog limped past us, trailing blood and looking back over its shoulder as if begging someone to explain why the sky was falling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Shadows of looters darted through alleyways, some clutching sacks of stolen bread or jewelry, others just running with nowhere left to go. Fistfights broke out in front of shuttered doors as families clawed for space in already overflowing wagons. Desperate townsfolk clung to shattered homes, shouting the names of loved ones lost in the smoke. From the direction of the mayor’s hall, thick black smoke rose in columns. Somewhere nearby, a woman screamed, her voice breaking into sobs before vanishing beneath the roar of collapsing stone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">And above it all, the moon had descended so far it now scraped the clouds—massive, luminous, a swollen leering god of stone. Its hateful gaze burned down upon the Tower, casting the world in a deepening crimson glow</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">We threw open the inn's doors to find it transformed into a ruin. Shelves splintered, chandeliers shattered, paintings torn from the walls. The faint scent of smoke filtered from upstairs. In the wrecked kitchen, we found Anju collapsed on the floor, cradling a photograph to her chest, her sobs muffled by the cacophony outside. Shards of broken dishes glittered like teeth around her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She was startled at our approach. "Oh! Miss Link! W-what happened to you? Why are you still in town!?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I have unfinished business at the top of the Clock Tower," I said breathlessly. "Do you know how to get up there?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"The Tower opens at midnight for the Festival of Time," Anju whispered, her voice cracking. "It was supposed to begin tonight. But now... now it may all vanish before it begins."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl spun around me in a panic. "Midnight?! Link, it's almost midnight now!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I turned to run, but Anju's cry stopped me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Wait! Please! If you see this man—</span>
      <span class="c16">my</span>
      <span class="c8"> Kafei—tell him I’m waiting! Please!" She ran toward me, holding out the photograph with trembling hands.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I took the picture. A young man with striking blue hair, red eyes, and a sapphire pendant stared back. He looked regal, gentle, full of promise.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"He was supposed to marry me tonight... and he vanished three days ago. I... I can’t go on without him."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tears spilled through her fingers. Without thinking, I dropped to my knees and held her. "I’ll find him. I swear. Now stay safe!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Just then, the building shook with an ear-splitting roar. The walls cracked, a wooden beam splintered above us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"We have to go!" I grabbed Anju’s hand and bolted for the exit. We exploded through the doors just as the inn collapsed behind us in a storm of dust and flame.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"C’mon! We can't stay here!" Tatl cried as buildings crumbled and fire rained from splintering rooftops.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Anju tore her hand away. "GO! I have to stay! For Kafei!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I hesitated. Just long enough to nod.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Then I ran.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">We raced toward the Tower, dodging falling beams, splitting earth, and gouts of flame as the heavens howled. Time had run out.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The end of the world had begun.</span>
    </p>

      <span class="c14">End of the Beginning</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The fearsome wind screamed through the skies, shredding banners and sending debris flying like shrapnel. The earth convulsed with escalating fury, rupturing stone and shattering roads as the terrible lunar ceiling lowered by the minute. The crumbling city around me was a ghost of its former self—barren, broken, forsaken. All who could flee had already vanished, and those who remained were swallowed by the void. Gravity itself seemed unhinged, torn in a cosmic tug of war between the dying world and the monstrous moon, which now loomed so close its craters were visible in terrifying clarity. Chasms cracked open beneath abandoned homes, devouring entire sections of the town like a beast gnashing its teeth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I stood with Tatl at the base of the massive Clock Tower, the very ground beneath us trembling like a dying heartbeat. From above, the bellowing tones of midnight thundered across the city, each chime sounding more like a funeral bell than a celebration. Somehow, impossibly, the monolithic clock stood unbroken—its ancient face staring defiantly into the eye of the apocalypse. Fireworks launched from its heights, desperate and bright, as if their flaring brilliance could push back the doom that crept ever closer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I heard the grinding of great gears behind the cacophony and bolted toward the sound. On the ledge Tatl and I had found earlier, a gaping entrance yawned open where once there was only stone. I sprinted up the ramp, wind clawing at my cloak, and threw myself through the doorway. Inside was a dust-caked elevator shaft, dimly lit and swaying with each quake. A single iron lever jutted from the left wall like a relic. I yanked it hard as a distant building groaned and collapsed in a plume of fire.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The doors creaked shut behind us, sealing out the chaos, and the elevator began to rise with a lurch. A wave of vertigo swept through me, amplified by the swirling sensation tightening in my skull. My breath came in ragged pulses. I felt dizzy, unstable, as if the world outside and the world inside me were both unraveling at once. My limbs felt too long, too light, as if I were being remade again mid-ascent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl hovered beside me, wings fluttering erratically. "Here we go, Link. This is it! All we have to do is get your instrument back, and it will all be over!" she said, but her voice trembled under the weight of uncertainty.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I nodded, rolling my shoulders and bending my legs, trying to center myself. My outfit was still smeared with grime from the morning's crawl through the sewers, but that didn’t matter now. All that mattered was reclaiming the Ocarina. Returning to normal. Escaping this strange, unfamiliar body. But a quiet dread gnawed at the back of my mind—what if there was no going back? What if this body, these curves, this voice, this frame... had already become part of me?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I didn’t know how I would survive the apocalypse, but I knew one thing for sure:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I didn’t want to die like this. And I sure as hell didn’t want to stay this way in the afterlife, if there even was one.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The elevator slowed, shuddering to a groaning halt. The doors yawned open, and I stepped out warily onto the wide, bowl-like platform. Wind whipped around me, screaming like the voices of the dead, but here at the tower’s peak, there was an eerie stillness—a hush before the end. Far above, the moon leered like a flaming god, pulsing with violent crimson light. Below, the world buckled and burned.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Skull Kid hovered several meters off the platform, his small body limp in the air like a puppet held aloft by strings of shadow. Darkness bled from the mask that clung to his face, oozing and writhing in waves that shimmered with malice. And there beside him—trembling, wings flickering weakly—was Tael.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Tael!" Tatl cried out, her voice cracking. "Get away from him!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Sis! You came back!" The purple fairy turned to us, relief bursting through his trembling glow. "You gotta help me! Skull Kid's not listening to reason! He's lost!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Slowly, Skull Kid turned to face us. The movement was unnatural—slow, deliberate, like a marionette yanked against its will. In one hand, he twirled my Ocarina, rolling it across his fingers with a cruel carelessness, as if it were no more than a polished pebble.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Well, well, well… Look who decided to show up! I figured you'd still be stuck in that cave I left you in. But no matter... I'm thrilled to see the spell worked! That’s a </span>
      <span class="c16">great</span>
      <span class="c15"> look for you, Mr. Big Shot. Or should I say… </span>
      <span class="c16">Miss</span>
      <span class="c8"> Big Shot! Heeheeheehee! Not so threatening now, are you, little girl?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">His laughter rang out across the basin like a blade drawn across glass—sharp, awful, triumphant. The platform beneath me trembled with every cackle, and sparks of energy hissed from the mask like venomous snakes. Rage surged through me, hot and steady. I wouldn’t let him humiliate me again. I reached for my bow...but Tatl darted in front of me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Skull Kid! LOOK at what you’re doing! Look around you! Everything’s falling apart! You need to STOP!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Who's gonna stop me, traitor?! You and your pretty new friend? Ha!" Skull Kid cracked into a fit of laughter again, but it was strained now—like something else was laughing through him, stretching his voice beyond what it was meant to carry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tael darted forward, wings quivering. He turned to the fractured horizon and cried out with all he had:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Swamp, Mountain, Ocean, Canyon! Those who are there, come here, to our hour of need! Please!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">His voice echoed across the burning sky. For a split second, it seemed like the wind itself paused to listen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">In a blur of dark light, Skull Kid lashed out, smacking Tael to the platform. The fairy bounced off the stone with a cry and lay still, wings dimmed and twitching faintly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Shut UP, stupid fairy!" he shrieked, eyes glowing too brightly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Tael!" Tatl wailed, flying to her brother's side. "Don’t you </span>
      <span class="c16">dare</span>
      <span class="c8"> hurt my brother, Skull Kid! That’s it. We are DONE being your friends!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">Skull Kid paused. The mask pulsed once—deep, throbbing, like a heartbeat from within a grave—and then he gave a careless shrug. "Whatever. Like I care. You’ll all pay either way. </span>
      <span class="c16">Nothing</span>
      <span class="c8"> can stop me now!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">He turned his face skyward and raised his arms. The mask’s jagged heart-horns flared with purple light, and a shriek—inhuman, ancient, and impossibly loud—tore through the sky like the cry of a god in agony. From the mask erupted tendrils of writhing violet energy, screaming into the clouds. They struck the moon like a whip, and the moon </span>
      <span class="c17">responded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">A deafening roar cracked the heavens. Flames burst across the moon’s surface like bleeding wounds. It started to </span>
      <span class="c17">accelerate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Faster.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Closer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Downward.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Link! What do we do?!" Tatl shouted to be heard over the deafening howl of wind and collapsing stone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I reached behind me, heart hammering, and grabbed the Great Fairy's bow slung across my back. Drawing a glowing arrow, I took aim while Skull Kid cackled in triumph, his guard momentarily lowered. I loosed the magic bolt. It sliced through the air with a high-pitched hum and struck the back of his head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The arrow of light didn’t pierce him—the dark aura enveloping him rippled like a living thing and absorbed most of the force—but the impact was enough. He reeled, staggering in midair like a puppet with cut strings. With a startled grunt, he dropped my Ocarina.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The sacred instrument struck the stone platform with a ringing thud that echoed like a chime through the sky.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Good shot, Link!" Tatl cried. "He dropped your thingy! I'll distract him—go!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She zipped toward Skull Kid in a blur of defiant light, weaving around his slashing arms and tugging at his tattered cloak. He snarled and swiped, eyes blazing, utterly focused on the annoying glimmer in his face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I locked onto the Ocarina lying beneath him. My heart surged. That small, gleaming artifact held everything—my identity, my power, my path home.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I broke into a sprint, boots pounding the trembling stone. Just before reaching it, I dropped into a slide and scooped the Ocarina from the ground in one smooth motion. The second my fingers touched its sacred curves, a searing warmth shot up my arms—and the world shattered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre5">
        <img alt="" src="images/image2.png" title="" class="calibre6"/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Time froze.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Light and memory surged around me, and suddenly I was no longer atop the Clock Tower. I stood in the Temple of Time. Moonlight filtered through high stained glass windows, and the air smelled of old stone and divinity. My body… was my old body. Stronger. Broader. Familiar.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Zelda stood beside me, serene and radiant, her golden hair cascading in soft waves. She held the Ocarina in both hands, her eyes solemn.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"You must do what you feel you have to... but please, take this," she said gently.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I took the Ocarina from her. The moment it touched my hands, the temple pulsed with magic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Link, always remember this. As long as you hold this Ocarina, you hold Time itself within your hands."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She raised it to her lips. The first notes of the Song of Time filled the chamber—soft, mournful, eternal. The melody swelled and echoed through the sacred space, wrapping around me like a blessing, or a farewell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">As the last note faded, Zelda lowered the instrument and looked at me one final time. Her expression was bittersweet—hopeful and heartbroken.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Always hold this song within your heart," she whispered, "and the goddesses will keep you safe from the ravages of Time."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The vision dimmed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">And then the whiteness took me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I was back at the top of the Clock Tower, the lunar inferno still blazing through the sky like a comet of wrath, tearing the very air apart. The heavens were aflame, stained with crimson and orange as though the gods themselves had bled across the firmament. Thunderous cyclones of fire swept over the land, setting entire fields ablaze. Massive earthquakes cracked the crust of the earth, toppling towers and swallowing screaming souls. Somewhere beneath all of it, Tatl still danced desperately through the smoke, distracting Skull Kid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"What are you doing?! This is no time for daydreaming, Link!" Tatl cried as she dodged a blast of dark energy. "Surely there must be </span>
      <span class="c16">something</span>
      <span class="c8"> you can do?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Oh Goddess of Time, save us!" I heard Tael gasp, his tiny voice raw and trembling. He clung to his sister in one final, fragile embrace.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">My heart surged. The moment crystallized. I </span>
      <span class="c16">knew</span>
      <span class="c8"> what to do.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I raised Zelda's Ocarina to my lips, my hands trembling but sure. I closed my eyes. My breath steadied. The world raged around me, but I shut it out. My fingers moved on their own, gliding across the sacred instrument’s familiar surface. The Song of Time spilled from me like a river long dammed, its notes cutting through the thunder and flame like bells tolling from another world.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">With the final note, the Ocarina pulsed with blue light—gentle and defiant. The air bent. Time shuddered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The world fizzled, unmade at the edges. Everything stretched into streaks of golden light, drawn upward and inward. I felt myself dissolving into the current of time, my soul launched backward through memory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Images blurred past: the hollow forest where I'd first met Skull Kid, the plunge through the gaping tree trunk, faces swirling like reflections on water. I saw the curse envelop me, the twisted laughter, the metal door beneath the tower—</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Then silence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Then light.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I opened my eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Sunlight poured down upon me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I stood again at the base of the Clock Tower. The Ocarina of Time dimmed in my hand, still warm from the song. Tatl hovered beside me, her glow bright but uneven, flickering with disbelief.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Wha…? What just happened?" she breathed. Her eyes darted to the familiar stonework around us. "Are we... back to that first day?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She zipped skyward and gasped at the blue dome above. The moon was high and distant again, no longer tearing through the sky like a blade.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"D-did you... just turn back time?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I was just as stunned. The world was </span>
      <span class="c16">whole</span>
      <span class="c8">. The cracked scaffolding was reduced to its earlier frame. The scent of smoke and blood was gone, replaced with fresh-cut wood and morning dew. Construction workers hammered rhythmically at half-finished platforms. Merchants chatted. Townspeople bustled. Guards patrolled, unaware of the apocalypse they narrowly escaped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I guess I did..." I murmured, then touched my throat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">My voice was still high, unmistakably feminine. A flash of irritation passed through me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I looked down at myself. Still the same soft, rounded form. Still the same clothes Tatl had found. At least they were clean now, and the enchanted bow remained strapped to my back. But inside, nothing had reset.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl floated closer, inspecting me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"But... you're still a girl?" she whispered. "You were only </span>
      <span class="c16">just</span>
      <span class="c8"> beginning to change when we were here last... Were we not affected by the song like everything else?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I guess not," I said through clenched teeth, heat creeping into my cheeks. "Let's just find the mask salesman again. He said he could cure me if I got my stolen item back."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">As if on cue, the heavy Clock Tower doors groaned open, their wooden frames creaking like ancient bones. The Happy Mask Salesman emerged, his wide, unsettling grin stretching across his face. He motioned with a frantic hand, his shadow long and twitching under the light.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Come, come! Quickly now!" he urged, his voice sharp with urgency.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I startled, heart still pounding from the temporal plunge. Swallowing my suspicion, I followed Tatl close behind. Inside, the din of Clock Town vanished like a dream fading at dawn. All that remained was the slow, rhythmic churn of gears overhead and the eerie hush of something ancient waiting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The salesman stopped in the middle of the circular chamber. His hands folded together with unsettling grace.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Well done, young hero! I'm </span>
      <span class="c16">so</span>
      <span class="c8"> very pleased. Now—did you manage to reacquaint yourself with your sacred item?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Yes, but it was no easy task," I replied, still winded. I lifted the Ocarina with care, the blue sheen of its surface catching the dim light. "Here it is."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Ahh, marvelous! Just as I hoped!" the man exclaimed, clapping once with a sound too sharp to feel real. "With this, yes, I can help restore what was broken. I can teach you to mend your spirit... and return you to your true form."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">He gave a bow and twirled toward the far wall, his steps jerky and uncomfortably gleeful. Then, as if summoned by thought alone, a colossal pipe organ faded into view—its twisted brass pipes blooming from the wall like metallic vines.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Now, listen carefully," he said, sliding onto the bench with twitchy reverence. "This melody holds magic older than the mask. If played by one who </span>
      <span class="c16">believes</span>
      <span class="c8">, it heals not only the flesh... but the soul. The Song of Healing, it is called."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">He pressed the keys. The first notes were low and hollow—then swelled into something haunting, aching, whole. The song rang out into the chamber, folding itself around me like memory. Each phrase seemed to reach through the bones of the tower and brush the edges of the world itself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">When the final chord faded, the salesman turned to me, eyes wide and waiting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I raised the Ocarina. My breath shook.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">With a steadying inhale, I played. The tune felt like it had always been within me, waiting to be remembered. The song poured out in smooth spirals, wrapping me in peace, as if the instrument and I were becoming one. The chamber pulsed. The shadows leaned in.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Then came the pain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">At first, it was no more than pressure behind my sternum. But it bloomed, rapidly—sharp, blooming fire. My limbs locked. My skin crawled. I gasped and crumpled, every nerve alight. It felt like I was being peeled away from myself, like layers were sloughing off beneath invisible hands. The Ocarina tumbled from my grip, ringing against the stone floor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I screamed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">My bones shifted with wet, muffled pops.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I gasped... a sound caught somewhere between a moan and a sob. My spine compressed with a crackling pulse, hips wrenching outward with a jarring tug, as though I were being sculpted by some cruel artisan. I could </span>
      <span class="c16">feel</span>
      <span class="c15"> the flesh at my waist drawing inward, tightening around a frame that was no longer mine. Breasts swelled again—round, aching, undeniable—and this time there was no ambiguity. The sensation wasn’t just change; it was </span>
      <span class="c16">confirmation.</span>
      <span class="c8"> A terrifying solidifying of a direction I hadn’t chosen, carved into my very marrow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">My hands, still gloved, grasped blindly at the floor. They were too small, too light—fingers delicate and trembling like those of a porcelain doll. Every nerve pulsed with raw electricity. My tunic clung differently now—tight across my chest, snug around my hips. The shifting undergarments offered no comfort, their unfamiliar tug a constant reminder that the change had not merely returned—it had progressed</span>
      <span class="c16">.</span>
      <span class="c15"> Feminine in a way that felt impossibly </span>
      <span class="c17">complete.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I whimpered. My voice broke high, bright, unmistakably sweet...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">Then the light deepened. I arched against the pull of it, crying out again as something inside me—</span>
      <span class="c16">deep</span>
      <span class="c8"> inside—was drawn upward like thread through a needle. I felt it stretch, burn, and snap, replaced by an aching hollowness... or perhaps something new. A sharp, hard clatter struck the floor beside me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">When the radiance finally receded, I was curled on the Clock Tower floor, every breath a shallow flutter in my chest. The Song of Healing had done </span>
      <span class="c16">something</span>
      <span class="c8">—yes—but not what I had pleaded for. Not a restoration.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The hush that followed rang louder than the scream.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl hovered nearby, her wings twitching. "L-Link... are you okay?" Her voice was barely audible.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I opened my mouth. The words faltered in a voice that didn’t belong to me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Then came the Salesman. His hands folded in delight. His voice too pleased.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Oh my... this is most unexpected. Most unexpected indeed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">His smile did not reach his eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre3">
        <img alt="" src="images/image1.png" title="" class="calibre4"/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">And in that moment, I realized: whatever I had become... it was no longer reversible by song alone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">Tatl fluttered around me in slow, hesitant arcs, as if unsure whether she should speak or even </span>
      <span class="c16">touch</span>
      <span class="c8"> me. Her glow was dimmer than usual, flickering with uncertainty, like she too had been affected by the song's backlash.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"You... you're not better," she whispered. "You're... worse."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I turned to look at her, but the motion sent a curtain of hair swinging against my cheek—a sensation so alien, so </span>
      <span class="c16">intimate</span>
      <span class="c8">, it made me flinch. My hair. It was longer now. Thicker. A deep, rich scarlet that shimmered in the tower’s low light, cascading down my back like a velvet banner.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">My throat clenched. I tried to speak again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Tatl, I—" The voice that came out wasn’t mine. It was soft, lush, unmistakably shaped by a different biology. A voice meant for songs, not shouts. Even the </span>
      <span class="c16">act</span>
      <span class="c8"> of speaking felt unfamiliar—like my new body demanded grace, whether I gave it or not.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl recoiled slightly, wings pausing mid-beat. "That... doesn't sound like you're better..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"I know." I touched my throat and winced. My fingers were slimmer, my nails subtly glossed. Even that—</span>
      <span class="c16">that tiny, pointless flourish</span>
      <span class="c8">—felt like a betrayal. A detail I would never have chosen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The Mask Salesman clapped his hands, humming like a man at a garden party. "Ahhh! Such a transformation! A blossom in full bloom! Yes, yes, very good. Quite elegant."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Shut up," I snapped. But the fury didn’t land—it floated out of me like a panicked melody. No edge. No weight.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I needed to </span>
      <span class="c16">see.</span>
      <span class="c8"> I staggered toward the great gear’s polished hub. The metal was scratched and weathered, but there in its center was a clear, silver circle—reflective enough to show the truth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I climbed onto the rim, heart pounding. Then I looked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">The girl in the reflection was beautiful. </span>
      <span class="c16">Painfully</span>
      <span class="c8"> so.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Delicate. Ethereal. A vision sculpted from someone else’s dream.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Her eyes were impossibly bright—emerald green like sunlit forest leaves after rain—wide and shimmering with unspeakable confusion. Thick, dark lashes framed them like delicate shutters. Her face was narrow and heart-shaped, kissed with the faintest blush, and her pouty lips parted in breathless disbelief.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Scarlet hair, deep and dark like fresh-spilled wine, cascaded over her shoulders in glossy waves, some strands clinging damply to the line of her jaw. Her cloak, slightly askew, slipped down from one sculpted shoulder, revealing the delicate slope of her collarbone and the gentle swell of a too-soft form that hadn’t been mine a day ago.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Even her posture betrayed me—hips cocked subtly, legs angled with an accidental grace I hadn’t earned. She looked like someone meant to be protected, not someone who had spent years fighting to protect others.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">And when I raised my hand to my mouth in stunned horror... she did the same.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I hated her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I'm not... me," I whispered, voice trembling with a grief too sharp to cry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">Behind us, the Salesman shuffled forward, hands folded like a prayer. "A miscalculation, perhaps. But one with potential! Oh yes, oh yes, tremendous potential! You still </span>
      <span class="c16">have</span>
      <span class="c8"> your old self, yes yes—it's all right there in the mask."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">He pointed behind me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">And there it was.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">A wooden mask, carved with haunting precision to match my old face. Lifelike. Vacant. A cruel parody of memory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">It stared up at me from the floor like a severed head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"What did you do to me?!" I screamed. The words tore out in a high, keening wail...not a roar, not a command....</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">A cry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">And he only smiled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I am, to be quite fairly honest, unsure what happened. This is most unexpected…" he repeated, placing a long, pale hand against his chin in mock contemplation. His eyes twitched—too bright, too calm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I’d had enough.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I drew my bow in one fluid motion and trained it on the trickster. The silvery string thrummed as it stretched, the light arrow blooming to life with a hiss of power. His smile faltered. He raised both hands in a flutter of alarm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"My, my, my! I do indeed understand your anger! But—please—I do believe I’ve deduced what went wrong, yes I have!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">He turned and gingerly plucked the mask from the floor—</span>
      <span class="c16">my</span>
      <span class="c8"> face, still carved in haunting detail—and held it up with a kind of reverence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"The song I taught you restores spirits broken by fate," he explained, his tone delicate, almost giddy. "But the magic that </span>
      <span class="c16">cursed</span>
      <span class="c15"> you—it did more than remold your flesh. It reshaped your </span>
      <span class="c16">soul.</span>
      <span class="c15"> Yes, yes! So when the melody did its work, it did not restore what you once were—it </span>
      <span class="c16">sealed</span>
      <span class="c8"> it. It purified what remained and placed it into this mask."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I stared at him, horror rising like bile. "So what? I'm stuck like this forever?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I yanked the bowstring tighter. The glowing bolt flared, casting trembling light on his face. "I </span>
      <span class="c16">cannot</span>
      <span class="c8"> be like this forever!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"No! Heavens no!" the Salesman sputtered, eyes wide and wild. He sank to one knee, holding the mask out like a holy offering. "If you place this mask upon your face, you will return to your original body. I promise you, young hero! Just please, lower your weapon."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Slowly, I eased the string back. The arrow fizzled, and my shoulders fell with the weight of doubt. I lowered the bow—but not my guard.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I stepped forward and took the mask. It was warm. Too warm. Tatl zipped in front of me, placing herself between the mask and my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Link, wait! We can't trust him. What if it’s another trick? You saw what that song did to you. What if this just makes it worse?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I looked past her, straight into the Salesman's pleading gaze. "You have </span>
      <span class="c16">got</span>
      <span class="c15"> to be kidding me," I said, my voice trembling on the edge of disbelief. "You expect me to trust you? </span>
      <span class="c16">Look</span>
      <span class="c8"> at me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">The Salesman clasped his hands, eyes shining with desperation. "Please, young hero. You must believe me! You are the only hope this world has. If your body disturbs you so deeply, then yes—place the mask upon your face. And you will be </span>
      <span class="c16">you</span>
      <span class="c8"> again. Yes, yes. I swear it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The mask in my hand pulsed faintly. It almost... called to me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">But so did the ache in my chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">So did the fear in my bones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c18">
      <span class="c8">
        <br class="calibre"/>
        <br class="calibre"/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl tried to discourage me, her voice sharp with fear, but I stepped forward anyway. Something in the Salesman’s pleading tone—frantic and too eager—gripped me with a sick sort of hope. I took the eerily familiar mask from his trembling hands, and he rose to his feet, bowing low with theatrical reverence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"That mask contains your former spirit, yes yes," he murmured. "Merely putting it on will restore your original shape—it will, it will!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl hovered near the reflective gear, her glow dimmed and uncertain. I turned the mask over slowly in my hands, my stomach knotting. The wood pulsed—warm and strangely alive, like it still remembered the rhythm of my breath. My old face stared up at me. Familiar, yes... but hollow. Lifeless. A fossil of identity.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"You really think this will work?" I asked, cringing at the softness still threading my voice. Tatl said nothing. The Salesman nodded with that same unblinking smile.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I hesitated only a moment longer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Then I pressed the mask to my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">It </span>
      <span class="c16">moved</span>
      <span class="c8">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">Not like something worn—but something claiming. The back writhed and </span>
      <span class="c16">latched</span>
      <span class="c8">, a vine of bone and memory curling into my skin. My breath caught. My chest seized.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">A muffled scream escaped me as my spine </span>
      <span class="c16">cracked</span>
      <span class="c8">, folding inward with unnatural force. My shoulders wrenched wide, arms stretching, muscle re-forming along their lengths. My hips cinched in sharply, ribs groaning as they collapsed into a narrower frame. My chest flattened with a fiery compression that stole the air from my lungs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">Tatl screamed something—but I couldn’t hear it. Not over the </span>
      <span class="c16">tearing</span>
      <span class="c8">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">My arms bulked up, joints popping as strength returned like thunder beneath my skin. My legs extended, knees locking, feet reforming with painful cracks as they filled out heavy, mud-caked boots I hadn’t seen in what felt like years.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">With a sickening jolt, weight surged back into my body. I was </span>
      <span class="c16">heavy</span>
      <span class="c8"> again—solid, masculine, grounded. The gentle, swaying grace of my former form vanished beneath returning muscle and grit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">And still... the mask clung to me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">It squeezed tighter. It </span>
      <span class="c16">loved</span>
      <span class="c15"> me. My jaw stretched, grinding into its old shape. My voice box cinched like a fist closing inside my throat. I gasped, and the sound that came out was deep, ragged— real.... </span>
      <span class="c16">me</span>
      <span class="c8">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">The shifting finally eased, and I collapsed forward, heaving. I could feel the sword and shield heavy on my back, replacing the slender arc of the Great Fairy’s bow. My Kokiri tunic—green, battered, </span>
      <span class="c16">mine</span>
      <span class="c8">—hugged my muscular torso like a returning memory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I stumbled toward the reflective gear. Tatl exhaled, her wings trembling with cautious relief.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">My boots thudded against the wood as I stepped up. I stared.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Pale blue eyes. Short blond hair. Gauntlets. Warrior’s jaw. The weight of countless battles written across my frame.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The Hero of Time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Thank the gods," I breathed, stunned by the baritone thrum of my own voice. "You were telling the truth."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Indeed, young hero, I was!" the Salesman chirped, folding his hands. "But do remember—it is only temporary. Your </span>
      <span class="c16">spirit</span>
      <span class="c15"> is changed, yes yes. Until you retrieve </span>
      <span class="c16">my</span>
      <span class="c8"> mask... I’m afraid it will remain so.""</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c18">
      <span class="c8">
        <br class="calibre"/>
        <br class="calibre"/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"But how are we supposed to get it back?" Tatl interjected, her voice sharp with frustration. "Skull Kid is just too powerful now! We could barely even faze him—how are we supposed to </span>
      <span class="c16">defeat</span>
      <span class="c8"> him?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I stomped toward the mask salesman, armored boots clanking against the floor, my gauntleted fist clenched with renewed determination.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I can beat him now. I’m back to normal. He’s not going to be a problem."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"No, no," the Salesman said gravely, shaking his head with a grimace. "Your little friend is quite right. The dark magic within that mask has twisted him, granted him strength beyond comprehension. You would not triumph. You would perish."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"But you </span>
      <span class="c16">just</span>
      <span class="c8"> said I was the only hope!" I snapped. "What, have you changed your mind already?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Heavens, no! You </span>
      <span class="c16">are</span>
      <span class="c8"> the world’s only chance, yes yes!" he said, wringing his hands. "But you cannot defeat this evil with strength alone. No, no, you must heal the wounded hearts and tormented spirits of this land. You must bring them to your side for the final confrontation. Only united, only then, can the mask’s power be truly overcome."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">Tatl hovered beside me, wings flickering in disbelief. "Heal the </span>
      <span class="c16">souls</span>
      <span class="c15"> of the land? What does that even </span>
      <span class="c16">mean</span>
      <span class="c8">? How does that stop Skull Kid from obliterating everything?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"The mask </span>
      <span class="c16">feeds</span>
      <span class="c8"> on suffering, thrives on hatred and despair!" he declared. "If you undo the pain it has caused, its strength will weaken. That lovely little tune you’ve learned—it will be crucial, yes! Have faith in the melody, have faith in each other!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I crossed my arms, still unsure. "Right... faith. That’s easier said than done. Where exactly do I start? Healing hearts isn’t exactly a sword-swinging sort of quest."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"No, no, it isn’t," the Salesman admitted, his voice now hushed and reverent. "But you have gifts, hero. Gifts you once used to bring joy, long ago. You must wield them again. Just as you did before. I believe in you! You’ve saved a world once—you can save this one, too. It is your </span>
      <span class="c16">destiny</span>
      <span class="c8">, yes indeed!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I stared. My chest tightened. I </span>
      <span class="c16">knew</span>
      <span class="c8"> him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">He really </span>
      <span class="c16">was</span>
      <span class="c8"> the same mask peddler from Hyrule.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I remembered helping him back then, giving away masks across the land. But how did he know about my journey? I’d never told anyone—not even the knights or my friends. Only Princess Zelda knew. How could </span>
      <span class="c16">he</span>
      <span class="c8"> know?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">There was more to this man. Far more.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Okay... I get it." I muttered. "You’re not just some merchant. You’ve seen more than you let on. But if the only way to truly change back is to stop Skull Kid and return your mask... then that’s what I’ll do."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Most excellent! How encouraging indeed!" he exclaimed, practically skipping with joy. "You </span>
      <span class="c16">will</span>
      <span class="c8"> succeed, I know it!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl awkwardly fluttered beside me, glancing at the salesman like he might sprout another head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Uhhh... we should probably get going now, right, Link?" she muttered, nudging my arm. She leaned close and whispered, "This guy really creeps me out. Let’s leave before he does something </span>
      <span class="c16">even</span>
      <span class="c8"> weirder."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Ohoho yes! No time for idle chatter, no no! Off you go! The fate of the world waits!" the Salesman laughed, eyes twinkling far too brightly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl zipped behind me in surprise, clearly not expecting to be overheard. I chuckled and shook my head. There was no fear in me now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I was </span>
      <span class="c16">back</span>
      <span class="c8">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Yeah... thanks. For turning me back. I’ll let you know how it goes."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I turned to leave, hand on the wooden doors.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Ah! Wait, young hero! One last thing!" the Salesman called, his voice echoing oddly in the chamber.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I paused, groaning softly. There’s </span>
      <span class="c16">always</span>
      <span class="c8"> a catch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"You mustn’t wear the mask for long periods," he warned, suddenly grave. "Its magic draws from your spirit. Wear it too long... and you will become a husk. Dust. And with you, hope itself will fade."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I clenched my jaw. Of course. Of </span>
      <span class="c16">course</span>
      <span class="c8"> there was a cost.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Great. So how do I take it off? It’s attached to my face."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Why, like any other mask, of course! Just pull—and off it comes! Hoho!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I rolled my eyes. "Right. Just rip off my face. Got it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">With that, I shook my head, muttering under my breath, and opened the doors. The light poured in—bright and blinding. Tatl hovered at my side, and I stepped forward, leaving the strange chamber behind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The next chapter of my quest had begun.</span>
