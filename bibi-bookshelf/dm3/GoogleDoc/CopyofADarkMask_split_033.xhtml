    </h1>
    <p class="c10">
      <span class="c41"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">The bonfire’s light cast long, flickering shadows across the twilit grove, turning the moss-covered stones and gnarled roots into shapes that felt older than memory. Two Goron guards flanked me, their grips like iron clamps on my shoulders—unyielding, unshakable. I didn’t struggle. I knew better. Every inch of my body warned me that a single twitch could lead to shattered bones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Around us, a low chorus of deep voices rumbled in the dusk: chanting, humming, something between mourning and ritual. I couldn’t see the source, but I felt the weight of it, vibrating softly through the earth beneath my boots. The ground thrummed with sorrow—slow, steady pulses like the heartbeat of something ancient and grieving. It was as if the very mountain remembered every loss ever suffered, and was mourning anew.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Each vibration carried something deeper than sound—grief, longing, a quiet despair that seeped up through the soles of my feet and wrapped itself around my chest. It wasn’t just the air that was heavy—it was the feeling of losing something precious.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">I couldn't help but feel an oppressive sadness tighten around my own emotions, sinking into me like cold water.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">But I didn't dare move to see what was happening, for fear of my bones being crushed with just a simple gesture from one of the massive hands keeping me still. The elder Goron, who I assumed was the leader of the tribe, slowly approached with a strange, yet somehow familiar, lens held in his gnarled, stony hands. The artifact shimmered faintly in the firelight, and it reminded me of something I had found in my past...but I couldn't place it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">
        Most of the Gorons I could see in the camp, younger and heartier, stood a meter or more above my height—yet the hunched elder's faded blue eyes were level with mine. Almost face to face now, he studied me with a weathered intensity that made my skin prickle.
        <br class="calibre"/>
        Tatl hovered silently near my shoulder, unusually quiet. I could feel the tremble in her wings—not from fear, but from something deeper. She was feeling it too: the strange pull of sorrow that had thickened the very air here.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Then, with great care, he raised the lens between us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">It was definitely familiar... but also unlike anything I had ever seen. The frame was forged of dark volcanic iron, warped and weathered with age, wrapped in threads of silver that glinted like frost under the firelight. At its center pulsed a deep crimson gem, shaped like a watchful eye, its surface alive with shifting light. Runes spiraled along the metal edge—ancient script that shimmered faintly as if reacting to the presence of magic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">When he looked through it, the world felt like it was bending around me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">My own reflection shimmered in the gem—no, not just shimmered. It changed. Something beneath the surface stared back at me: not quite my face, not quite a stranger. The air grew heavier, and for a fleeting second I felt exposed—not just seen, but known.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Boromu's brow furrowed further, the lens trembling slightly in his grip. He lowered it slowly, as if reluctant, then cast a glance down my frame, pausing as if confirming something. Then he raised the glass eye again, the gem flashing with internal light.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"Curious... in all my years I've never seen such...."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">His gravelly voice trailed off into muttering, thick with wonder and unease. He slipped the lens into his sash with a reverence usually reserved for sacred relics, his sagging lips twisting into a strange pout.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"Elder Boromu, what is it? What did you see?" one of the guards asked reverently, clearly surprised.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"This human... there is a strange conflict within them. Two souls shifting back and forth between this one, and a warrior male garbed in green. How could this be?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">The elder came closer, and I caught the heavy stench of sulfur on his breath. I tried not to gag as he came within an inch of me, inspecting me with a gnarled finger pointed at my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"I'm not... from around here. My name is Link. I came from a land called Hyrule. I was riding my horse through the forest when I was suddenly ambushed by a Skull Kid wearing a strange mask. I tried to fight, but ended up getting cursed into... well, what you see now."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">When I mentioned Hyrule, the Gorons holding me notably stirred. Boromu merely gazed on with those old, weary eyes.... but he looked away at the mention of Skull Kid, giving me a moment to breathe freely. But when he turned back, something in his expression had hardened.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"Skull Kid... yes, I am familiar with his violent tricks. He came to our village days ago and demanded we serve him. I refused... and we've been suffering since. An eternal winter has fallen on our beloved mountains. Where there should be summer warmth, there are now blizzards and ice. We believe he tampered with our Divine Beast—a relic of a bygone era that controls weather."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">He paused, his gaze narrowing as he studied me anew.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"And you say you came from Hyrule..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">There was a note of unease in his voice. He turned slightly away, as if grappling with memory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"Our ancestors fled Hyrule long ago, seeking peace. That land was torn by chaos—wars, gods walking as men, men playing at gods. It was a place where stone cracked and rivers ran backwards. Many still speak its name only in whispers. That you survived such a place at all is... remarkable."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Boromu looked to the chanting circle, where the earth softly rumbled outward. The scent of scorched pine lingered faintly in the cold air, curling around the flickering shadows like smoke from a distant fire.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"Our greatest warrior, Darmani, went to confront the Skull Kid at Snowhead Temple, where we commune with the Beast. He sought to calm Goht and end this unnatural winter... but alas, he has met a terrible fate. I tell you this only because the lens does not lie. And according to the lens, you are trustworthy—however strange your cursed soul may be."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">His eyes drifted back to me with a forlorn expression, his lips twisted into a mournful curl. The firelight etched deep lines into his stone face, and the weight of memory seemed to sag from his shoulders.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"Darmani, our last hope, is dying. Slowly turning to stone and crumbling under a curse. Our priests cannot undo it; the magic is too strong. We came to Clock Town seeking help, thinking the humans might have strong remedies... but they proved to be treacherous thieves. They stole my son, for reasons I still do not understand. Their ways are strange to us. They value gold over honor. Material over Spirit."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">The wind shifted, carrying with it the scent of pine smoke and crushed herbs. The chanting in the distance deepened, as if the grove itself leaned in to listen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Boromu's old, faded eyes locked on mine, and I felt like my entire soul was laid bare beneath them—past, future, and everything in between.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"And yet, you, a soul conflicted by curses as well, who came from the war torn land of the ancients... returned him to me. I must ask, and you will answer truthfully... why?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">I hesitated. For a heartbeat, the question echoed through me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Because it was the right thing to do? Because I wanted to protect something? Because I couldn't save myself?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">But all I said was:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"Because no one else would."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Boromu studied me for a long moment. Then he nodded once, slowly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"Come. You will see Darmani. If the gods have placed you on our path, we shall follow it to the end."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">The elder motioned with a wave of his hand, and the others released their vice-like grip on my shoulders. I rolled them back with a wince, only now realizing how tight their hands had been against my narrower build. The ache lingered like phantom bruises.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Boromu began his slow shuffle toward the chanting circle, and I followed close behind. The vibration grew stronger with each step, resonating through my boots and up into my spine. Yet the chants did not grow louder. It was as if the Gorons were no longer speaking to each other, but to the mountain itself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Then, all at once, the chanting stopped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">The silence was absolute. Even the wind seemed to still. For a breathless moment, the grove felt like the eye of a storm—expectant, reverent, unnerving. The Ocarina in my satchel pressed gently against my hip, warm and faintly pulsing, as if aware of what was to come.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">When we reached the edge of the circle, the assembled Gorons stepped aside in solemn unison. I crossed the boundary, and the earth gave a soft groan beneath my feet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">At the center of the circle lay a massive Goron, unmoving. His form stretched long and broad, his bulk weathered by snow and time. He was so still, he could have been a sculpture—but he was no work of art. This was a body resisting death with every grain of stone. Most of his skin had turned to a dark, mottled grey, fractured like cooling lava. Only a few patches of the original russet-gold peered through near the joints and chest. Tiny flakes of crumbling dust fell from his shoulders with each subtle tremor in the ground.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">His face was locked in an expression of grim defiance—or was it pain? I couldn’t tell. Not until I stood before him did I realize how large he truly was. Even lying down, he towered over me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">The scent of burning pine and smoked sage still lingered in the air, curling low like ghosts around the stone circle. Clay pots of incense had been arranged with care near the giant's head, their embers glowing faintly as they sent delicate ribbons of smoke drifting through the cool breeze. The fragrances mixed with the earthy tang of moss and fire-kissed stone, creating a quiet sacredness that clung to the skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Boromu raised one arm slowly and gestured toward the fallen warrior.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"If you truly believe that you can help us, do so now."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">My thoughts went to the Ocarina resting in my belt pouch, and I gingerly pulled it free, feeling the smooth, cool material against my fingertips. It pulsed faintly with memory. Tatl, uncharacteristically quiet, hovered near my shoulder, her wings a faint glimmer in the dusk. She said nothing, but her silence was weightier than words. When I brought the Ocarina to my lips, she floated back and gave me space—a rare, reverent stillness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">I knew what I had to do.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">The notes of the Song of Healing flowed out in quiet ripples, soft and mournful. The melody hung in the grove like mist, echoing between the trees and the hearts of those gathered. Not a whisper could be heard. Even the fire seemed to bow to the music, its flames stilling just slightly with each note.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre5">
        <img alt="" src="images/image4.png" title="" class="calibre6"/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">When the last note faded into silence, nothing happened at first.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">The Gorons glanced around, unsure. The quiet felt heavier now, expectant. Then, a thin crack of light shimmered along the fault lines in Darmani's petrified skin—subtle, but unmistakable. Gasps rippled through the circle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">As if summoned by the song, the stone began to loosen. It crumbled and flaked away like old bark shedding from a tree, revealing the golden-brown hue of Goron flesh beneath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">The circle held its breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Darmani twitched. Barely. Then again. A finger curled. A massive chest lifted in a shallow breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">And then, as if released by some ancient spell, the crowd exhaled in unison as the fallen warrior began to breathe again on his own.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Darmani opened his eyes, slowly, as the last of the stone crumbled away. Tatl drew close to me and with a relieved smile, released a held breath of her own.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"Link... you did it! The song worked this time!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">The Elder Goron's throat grumbled in relief, staggering up to Darmani's head. With a gnarled hand, Boromu brushed debris off the giant's face, smiling with a mouth that had hardly any teeth left.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"Darmani... what a gift this child has brought us. We are saved!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">But the moment shattered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">The giant opened his mouth as if to speak, but suddenly he gasped in pain, clutching at his side with a ragged, rattling breath. The sound was wrong—wet, labored, desperate. Boromu's smile froze and fell away as he looked where Darmani was grasping. His eyes, so recently bright with hope, turned to dread.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">I followed his gaze.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Where once there had been only stone, now there was a deep, open gash. Blood, thick and dark blue, welled from it in sickening pulses, spilling across the mossy earth like ink from a cracked vessel. It soaked into the soil, steaming faintly in the cool air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"No... no no no," Tatl murmured beside me, her wings dimming, her voice shaking. "That wasn’t supposed to happen. He was supposed to be okay!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Boromu waved his cane at the circle, barking orders, calling for herbs, a dressing, anything to stop the flow. Gorons rushed forward with armfuls of green-smoked leaves and thick bandages, their heavy steps thudding desperately through the soil. But I knew. I could see it in Darmani's eyes—glassy, unfocused, already beginning to slip.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">I knelt beside him, barely breathing, and raised the Ocarina again with trembling fingers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"Please," I whispered, as much to the gods as to the instrument. "Not this. Heal him! Please...!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">I desperately brought the instrument to my lips again. The Song of Healing spilled out once more, trembling and raw. My breath hitched with every note, my hands unsteady, tears stinging behind my eyes. The song was slower this time—not a melody, but a plea. I played it again, and again... but nothing answered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Around us, the circle of Gorons fell into a mournful silence, their expressions stunned and helpless. Some had fallen to their knees. Others covered their faces with thick hands. Even the fire seemed to dim.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">But even before the final note echoed into silence, I felt it. The stillness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Darmani exhaled one last time. A soft glow began to rise from his chest, pale and golden. The wind caught it, swirling the light upward as the massive form of the warrior began to dissolve, fragment by fragment, into shimmering dust. Darmani's eyes looked up at Boromu with a deep sadness—a sense of failure, of hopelessness—resonated from them. His lips parted, as if to speak, but no words came. Only a shuddering breath. And then... the light in his eyes faded, like coals cooling in a hearth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">"No..." I choked, my voice breaking.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">I reached out without thinking, as if I could hold him here a moment longer — catch the light before it slipped away. My fingers brushed through warmth, through dust and radiance—until they met something solid. The sensation jarred me: not the hot, living skin of a warrior reborn, but the cool, resolute edge of carved stone. My hand, trembling, rested not on Darmani’s chest, but something else.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">The light swallowed him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Within seconds, only a faint outline of his body remained—and then, nothing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">Nothing but a single object remained, cradled beneath my trembling hand—resting gently where his heart had been.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">A mask.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">It bore Darmani's likeness in stone: solemn, strong, unyielding. The features were carved with grace and power, frozen mid-roar, like a silent monument to a warrior who had fought to the very end.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">I curled my fingers around it, lifting it into my hands. The weight was immense—far heavier than its size should allow. The stone was still warm, as if holding the last breath of the one who had worn it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">One of the younger Gorons let out a choked sob and fell to his knees, pounding the earth in rhythmic grief. Another tore fistfuls of dirt from the ground and pressed them against his brow, weeping openly. An older Goron sank to his haunches and began to sing, low and broken—a mourning song that trembled through the grove like the dying echoes of a bell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c33">The silence was no longer reverent — it was hollow, raw, and vibrating with everything they had just lost. I took up the mask and held it close, its edges rough beneath my fingers, its weight deeper than stone. I didn’t know if I had just been given a weapon, a grave marker, or the burden of a dying warrior’s final wish. But I could feel it—etched into the stone, humming against my chest—that this was not the end. It was a beginning. And it wasn’t mine alone.</span>
    </p>

    <h1 class="c25" id="h.xb3huuvbsl4h">
      <span class="c14">The Mask of the Mountain</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">At first, there was nothing but silence. Even the roaring fire seemed to silence itself, feeling muffled in the heavy air. And then, a single snowflake fell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Just one, drifting quietly from the darkened sky above the grove, landing without ceremony on the back of my hand. It clung there for a heartbeat—fragile, precise—before vanishing into my skin like a breath forgotten. Then another. And another.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Within moments, the first snows had begun.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">It wasn’t fierce. Not yet. It was gentle, almost reverent, as though the mountain itself was bowing its head to grieve. The embers of the sacred fire crackled softly behind me, casting a fading warmth on my back. Around the circle, the Gorons remained kneeling or standing in stunned silence, their broad forms hunched beneath the weight of the moment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Darmani was gone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">And in his place, I held a mask. As I stared at the mask, a tight knot of guilt twisted deeper into my chest. Darmani’s bravery left an echo in the air—reminding me uncomfortably of all the things I had failed to protect, all the lives slipping through my fingers like sand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I hadn’t moved in what felt like hours. My hands still cradled the carved stone, rough and warm with lingering spirit. It didn’t feel like a mask. It felt like a heart carved hollow, still echoing the last breath of its owner.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">A few snowflakes had settled on my head, melting immediately. The cold bearing down as if Darmani was the last bastion against the onslaught of winter. I let it. The cold seemed fitting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu stood nearby, his cane driven into the soft earth, his cracked eyes staring not at me, but at the hollow space where Darmani had vanished. He hadn’t said a word since.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The other Gorons were just as silent, but some of them held each other, others were broken down on the ground, faces in their hands. A young one pressed his forehead to the frozen earth, humming low and wordless. An elder had curled into himself, hands clutching smooth prayer stones etched in deep sigils, lips moving in a whisper too quiet to hear. Another Goron, broader than the rest, sat motionless with his hand outstretched toward the empty air where Darmani had disappeared, as if unwilling to believe the space was empty. Their grief filled the grove not with sound, but with presence—a pressure in the chest, a stillness in the trees, a heaviness in the snow as it began to gather.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Even Tatl seemed frozen—not from cold, but from reverence. Her wings fluttered just once as the snow began to fall, then stilled. The usual sharp glint in her voice had been smothered by the weight of what we’d witnessed.  Her glow dimmed to a pale shimmer, hovering uncertainly beside my shoulder. In that moment, even she seemed too fragile for words.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">It felt like time itself had stopped. The snow fell in slow spirals, each flake tracing its own path toward the earth like forgotten prayers. The air tasted of smoke and frost. The fire crackled behind us, brittle and subdued, casting weak shadows across the grove. No one moved. No one breathed loud enough to disturb the hush.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Until Boromu finally moved.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The elder exhaled slowly, the sound more like a landslide than a sigh. Then he turned to me—not with authority, but with something heavier. Expectation. Hope, maybe. Or resignation. The furrows in his stone face were carved deep by grief, yet something flickered there—a dim ember refusing to die.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"If you carry his mask," he said, voice rough with age and grief, "then you carry what remains of him. Whether you asked to or not."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I didn’t answer. I wasn’t sure I could. My throat was tight, my thoughts brittle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Snow began to gather in Darmani’s empty space—the last mark he’d left behind as he lay dying. It filled the depression slowly, gently, as if trying to erase the memory of his existence. But I couldn’t let it. I couldn’t look away. The swirl of snow blurred the edges of the hollow, like time trying to wash over pain too fresh to bury.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c18">
      <span class="c23"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The grief that weighed on this grove wasn’t mine alone. It clung to my shoulders, settled into my lungs, mixed with the steam of my breath. I needed space to think, to understand why I felt so connected to these Gorons—why it hurt so much to watch them break.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tears welled behind my eyes before I realized they’d been building. I turned from the fire’s last embers, retreating to the edge of the grove. There, beneath a leaning pine glazed in frost, I stopped. My hands clutched the stone Goron mask, cold and sharp like it was Darmani's resolve. Its expression—frozen in strength, carved in roar—felt like a question I couldn’t answer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The chill seeped in through my boots and into my chest, a creeping cold I couldn’t shake. Snow settled across my shoulders like quiet hands. I shivered hard, and then I felt Tatl’s glow at my shoulder—a faint pulse of warmth against the wind, like the last ember in a fading hearth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Link… are you okay?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Her voice was soft. Not teasing. Not biting. Just… worried.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I shut my eyes and looked away, jaw tight.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“I… I don’t know,” I whispered, my strength breaking. “This… this wasn’t supposed to happen. I keep losing, Tatl. I keep trying and nothing works. Ever since I left Hyrule... it’s like the gods are angry at me. Like they’re taking things away from me. One by one.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">My voice faltered, choked by the sharp sting rising in my throat. “And maybe... maybe they are. Maybe I turned my back on what I was meant to be. Maybe I abandoned the very path they gave me, and now they’ve abandoned me in return.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I could feel it, like a door had quietly closed somewhere far behind me. A divine silence. Not punishment. Not wrath. Just absence. The terrifying weight of being left alone—not by people, but by purpose.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The mask remained in my hands, unmoved. But something in its silence felt familiar. Like it knew that same emptiness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">And all I could hear was the wind whispering through the pines and the snow collecting the heavy silence like stones—patient, inevitable. It was as though the world itself had run out of answers. I stared into the mask, and the mask stared right back, almost as if in defiance to my weakness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">And then, it pulsed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">A slow, low vibration thrummed through my palms—not painful, but resonant, like a struck bell echoing through stone. The mask shimmered faintly, its eyes briefly catching the starlight. I gasped and almost dropped it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Did you feel that?" I whispered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl hovered a little closer, her glow dimming in awe. "Feel what? Are you—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">But before she could finish, the world shifted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">A rush of heat filled my chest, then my skull. The wind around us seemed to stop entirely. I blinked—and the pine forest vanished.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I was standing on a mountaintop.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Snow swirled in blistering waves around me. A horn sounded in the distance, deep and mournful. Goron voices echoed in a ritual chant, and then shattered into screams. I turned—behind me, a temple of stone and ice cracked open as a monstrous shape emerged, bound in chains of lightning and frost.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Goht.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I felt the bitter, biting cold of the mountaintop as if it were my own, tasted the coppery tang of blood from a wound I hadn't earned, and knew the grief and fury of a warrior staring down his final battle, knowing he would not survive, yet fighting all the same</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">I could feel the memory like it was </span>
      <span class="c30">mine</span>
      <span class="c23">. The cold. The fear. The duty. I was seeing through Darmani’s eyes—his final memory, left behind in the mask like a song trapped in stone. His last desperate stand. His failure. His sorrow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">And beneath it all... a plea.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The vision fell away as quickly as it had come. I staggered forward, heart hammering in my chest. The mask’s warmth faded, but the echo remained.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl hovered close again, breathless. “Was that…?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I nodded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“He wants me to finish it. He wants someone to carry it through.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The mask rested in my hands, still and heavy once more. But it no longer felt like just a relic. It felt like a bond. A burden passed through stone and time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">And I knew, whether I was ready or not—this was the path I would walk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">My fingers tightened around the stone edges. Without thinking, as if guided by something deeper than will, I lifted the mask.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Link, wait—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl’s voice didn’t reach me in time. The moment the mask touched my face, the world twisted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">A surge of heat slammed into my chest. My arms jerked backward, spine arching unnaturally as a tremendous force tore through my muscles, pulling my body outward, upward, </span>
      <span class="c30">wider</span>
      <span class="c23">. My skin split and reshaped itself in impossible ways, bones snapping and thickening, pain laced with something almost euphoric. My tunic burst at the seams. My boots cracked open. The mask fused to my face like molten iron—and then, like stone, it became me. My mind splintered under the surge of raw strength, both terrifying and exhilarating. Link—my true self—was slipping away, replaced by a powerful certainty that burned in every muscle and bone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">When I hit the ground, it cracked beneath me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">I gasped, but the sound that escaped my throat was no longer mine. It was a bass-heavy </span>
      <span class="c30">grunt</span>
      <span class="c23">, deep and gurgling like a landslide. I looked down—my arms were huge. Thick slabs of muscle covered in rough stone skin. My chest heaved, wide as a wagon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Hurr… what… happenin’…?” I mumbled. Even my voice was different—deep, guttural, and dim. My mouth wasn’t moving the way I expected. My tongue felt too big.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">"Oh… holy gods," Tatl murmured, darting around my shoulder. "You're... You're a Goron! But... wow. A </span>
      <span class="c30">huge</span>
      <span class="c23"> one."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I blinked slowly, my vision strange and heavy—like everything had slowed, just a little. My thoughts felt... distant. Sluggish. Like someone had packed cotton around my brain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I looked down at myself—at the broad, domed chest rising and falling like a boulder shifting with breath. My arms were massive, corded with muscle that looked less like flesh and more like carved basalt. My fingers ended in thick, ridged knuckles, like hammers shaped from stone. My once-loose tunic was now tattered cloth clinging awkwardly to the edges of a rocky torso, and my boots—what was left of them—had split wide to reveal massive feet ringed with stone-like ridges.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">A glowing sigil, faint but pulsing with each heartbeat, burned softly on my shoulder. My entire body radiated heat, like smoldering stone after a volcanic surge. I could feel strength in every movement, but control was slipping away, thought by thought. I was hulking. Heavy. A wall of living rock.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Somehow, it all felt familiar.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">My thoughts were thick. Like packed snow. But there was fire in my veins now. Pride. Duty. Something primal. The mask had given me this form for a reason—and I would use it. Smash ice. Protect tribe. That’s what Darmani wanted. That’s what I </span>
      <span class="c30">wanted</span>
      <span class="c23">. Right?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I notice the brothers standing behind me, looking at their hero reborn.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Elder Boromu speaks, his voice quivering with pride. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Darmani? Is that… -no, no you’re different. You wear green garb and strange armor. Are you… are you truly that human who played the melody that heals? We all felt its power… heard its wisdom. Darmani passed, but not in a way any of us thought possible in a long, long time. He gave his strength for you to borrow as gratitude for healing his spirit, through that mask. Through you… he can save us!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I felt honor and pride well up deep within my stones, my deepest hearts, and I raised a gigantic fist and roared back against the winter creeping up on us. I would be victorious! I would win! I would fight all threats that came my way! Suddenly I almost remembered what I was doing just moments before.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I turned to Tatl, confused. She hovered in silence for a moment, then groaned.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">“Oh no. Not just a Goron… You’re </span>
      <span class="c30">him</span>
      <span class="calibre1">. You’re Darmani. Or, uh… something very close. Just… maybe not all the way </span>
      <span class="c30">there.</span>
      <span class="c23">”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Not, Darmani…no. Link, uh..I am… Huh...?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I scratched my enormous head. My arms felt like cliffs. My hands—barely hands—were slabs of stone wrapped in muscle. Something was fuzzy. Not right. Thoughts made no sense. But I remembered that I had to smash winter! Break the ice!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Me… s’posed to smash ice now, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">Tatl buried her tiny face in her hands. “This is going to be </span>
      <span class="c30">exhausting.</span>
      <span class="c23">”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Already, I could feel something shifting inside me—sliding deeper. Thoughts grew slower. Simpler. Each word like a boulder I had to roll uphill.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I blinked. Tried to count. Wait… why count? Numbers were hard.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The world felt louder. Heavier. My heartbeat thudded in my ears like war drums.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Time passed oddly. A few minutes, maybe more. I tried to remember what I was doing… then forgot what I was remembering.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"RAHHH! WHERE ICE? ME BREAK BAD ICE!" I bellowed suddenly, slamming my fists together with a sound like thunder rolling through stone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl flinched, wings buzzing with alarm. Her glow flickered, unstable, and she backed away slightly. "Okay, that’s new. Link? Can you still hear me in there? Please, say something normal. Say anything."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">"Link? Me Link! ME </span>
      <span class="c30">STRONG ROCK GUY LINK</span>
      <span class="c23">, HA!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I laughed, big and echoing—like boulders laughing. Joke was strong. Me strong. Joke good.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">But Tatl didn’t laugh.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">She zipped in front of my face, her wings trembling now. "No no no—Link, come on. Look at me. Please look at me. You’re scaring me. This isn’t you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Her tiny hands reached forward, as if trying to grab my attention, to shake me out of it. Her voice cracked. "You’re losing it. You have to take the mask off before—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I try swat annoying bug away, flashy fairybug, urgh! Too bright. Too fast. No thinky.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Her light darted out of reach, her voice rising in panic now. "No—don’t do that! Link, please! You’re slipping too far—don’t leave me here alone!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The strength shake. My knees fall. Cracks through vision like stonebreak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I fall. Grow weak. Lose seeing… fall…</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">A deep groan escaped me as my body lurched forward, the mask peeling off my face. The world tilted. I collapsed with a thunderous thud, cracking the frozen dirt beneath me. A plume of powdery snow burst outward from the impact, and for a heartbeat I felt like the mountain itself had dropped through my chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The strength drained from me like sand through open fingers. My breath came in short, ragged gasps. The mask… it pulsed once beneath me, a strange, low throb like a heartbeat caught in stone. It was warm—not comforting, but alive, like a soul remembering it had once breathed. The sensation ran up my spine like an echo, not painful, but not gentle either—more like a distant voice calling through bone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">A final surge of heat spread through my chest like a dying heartbeat. My body began to shrink. Stone skin softened, splitting like a shell. Limbs curled inward, bone and sinew twisting and pulling tight as if retreating from the world. My spine bent sharply, ribs aching as my frame folded into itself. The weight of that other form peeled away in layers, and my mind reassembled itself in jagged flashes—thoughts stuttering into words, language reforming like ice cracking into sharp patterns.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Then came the sudden cold.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The sudden absence of that hulking strength was dizzying. Where once my center of gravity felt like a boulder, now I was a tangle of delicate limbs and aching joints. My breath fogged in the air. My shoulders folded as snow began to gather on me. My body shivered so hard I could hear my teeth knock together. I felt exposed. Small. Like a leaf that had just fallen from the tree I had been part of seconds ago.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I lay there, panting, my fragile body curling in on itself. The mask rested beside me like a spent heart, still faintly warm against the frost.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"...Tatl?" I croaked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">She hovered above me, blinking rapidly. Her glow was dim, uncertain. “Oh thank the gods... You’re back. Just barely.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Her wings trembled midair, and she darted in close, circling me once with nervous urgency before settling just beside my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“I didn’t know if you’d come back,” she whispered, her voice cracking. “You were gone, Link. Like… really gone. I was calling you and you didn’t even blink…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I blinked slowly, breath still shaking. My limbs felt like water, my muscles empty of anything but exhaustion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“I thought I’d lost you,” she murmured, barely above the hush of the wind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I remembered the sudden compulsion to put on the mask, my own arms betraying me as they forced it to my face. Tatl’s voice struck me with how much I scared her, and I recoiled from the mask that lay silent on the cold ground.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“I didn’t mean to…” I rasped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl hovered a little closer, her voice now more firm, but gentler than before. “I know. I know you didn’t. But next time, promise me something.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I glanced up at her, barely able to nod, my head still swimming from the effects of the change.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">“Don’t put it on unless we absolutely need to. I…um…</span>
      <span class="c30">we</span>
      <span class="c23"> can’t afford to lose you. Not like that.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I swallowed hard, the chill creeping back into my skin as the mask lay silently beside me. I glanced at it, then back to Tatl. I could only reply with…</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“I promise.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I groaned. My limbs trembled with the last of the lingering memory of Darmani... a memory of something ancient and terribly powerful. Lying in the snow, feeling painfully small and exposed, I understood something terrifying—how easily I could lose myself, not to darkness or evil, but to the simple comfort of unquestioned strength.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“We’re going to have to be… very careful with that thing.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">Tatl crossed her arms, frowning with concern but trying to keep her voice steady. "You were... completely gone, Link. I don’t even think you </span>
      <span class="c30">heard</span>
      <span class="c23"> me anymore. A few minutes more and you might’ve stayed gone..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I turned my head toward the mask, picking it off the ground and turning the heavy stone over in my hands. It looked harmless now—just a stone carving. But I could almost feel it watching me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I could still feel the echo of weight in my shoulders. The deep-throated roar in my ears. The mountain-heart pounding in my chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">Part of me missed it. The strength. The certainty. The fury. It reminded me of those early moments after the curse—when everything felt out of control, and I would have given anything just to </span>
      <span class="c30">know</span>
      <span class="c23"> what to do, to have purpose again. There was no fear in that form, no doubt, just motion and force. It was like being held in the arms of something terrible and vast—but safe from the cold of uncertainty. And now, stripped bare and small once more, I felt its absence like phantom limbs aching to be filled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">"It felt so... easy," I whispered. "Like I didn’t have to question anything. Just act. Be strong. Be </span>
      <span class="c30">sure.</span>
      <span class="c23">"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">Tatl's voice softened, landing beside my shoulder, her wings fluttering gently as if weighed down. She looked tired—emotionally drained—her light dimmed to a soft, flickering glow. There was worry in her eyes, but also a fragile relief, like someone who had just pulled a friend back from the edge of a cliff. "Yeah, well. That kind of power </span>
      <span class="c30">always</span>

      <span class="c30">destroy</span>
      <span class="c23">."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I nodded faintly, still staring at the mask. My breath clouded the air as I gazed over the edges of its worn stone features. Part of me missed it, missed the strength, the righteous fury... the sheer force of will.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">And that scared me more than anything else.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Suddenly, strong arms wrapped around me—like stone warmed from a fire and reverent—and I was lifted as if I weighed nothing at all. A dozen Gorons had gathered around, encircling me without my notice, their heavy brows furrowed with awe and something deeper. Their touch was gentle despite their size, like mountain winds cradling a falling leaf. One placed a hand softly on my back, steadying me not as a stranger, but as kin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I was carried back to the bonfire, its flames now crackling with renewed vigor. Sparks danced upward into the night like prayers rising skyward. Around it, the circle of stone guardians gathered. Their feet were planted like roots of a mountain, their fists resting over their hearts.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">They hummed a deep, resonant chant that vibrated up through my spine and into my ribs. It wasn’t a song made for the ears. It was for the soul. Each note reverberated through the snow-laced air like the pulse of the earth itself. I felt it stirring something in me—something old, something I didn’t recognize as mine, and yet remembered all the same.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl hovered beside me, silent but glowing warmly in the firelight, her presence a small anchor in the midst of so much reverence. She looked not at me, but at the Gorons, eyes wide with awe. Her wings flickered gently, as if moved by the music.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The chant rose with each breath the Gorons drew, echoing into the cold air and grounding itself into the very earth beneath us. It carried weight—like stone on the heart—but also comfort. I didn’t understand the words, but I knew the meaning. Honor. Grief. Hope.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Elder Boromu stepped forward, his cane tapping once against the wood of a fallen branch as he lifted his voice. His face looked older now, lined deeper with sorrow—but behind his eyes, something fierce still glowed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Link… Hero of the Draumorim, bearer of Darmani’s final breath, one who heard his call and answered with a roar. I ask you this—if the soul of our brother lives in you still, if his courage has found new flame in your heart, then speak now. Will you save us?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The heat from the bonfire wrapped around me, breathing warmth into my frozen limbs. My body still trembled from the transformation, but something inside me had settled. My heartbeat slowed. My breath returned.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I stood, slowly, legs wobbling beneath me like a newborn foal, but I stood. Around me, the Gorons watched with quiet intensity—no longer strangers. Brothers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“I will, Elder,” I said, my voice steadier than I expected. I met his eyes, then turned to the others. “You have my word.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Then come, brother, rest by the fire. Regain your strength.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The bonfire crackled warmly, sending dancing shadows across the clearing flattened by heavy feet. I nestled in beside it, the massive bodies of the Draumorim gathered loosely around the flames in a quiet, protective circle. Their presence—solid, unmoving—brought with it a strange sense of peace. I felt folded into something ancient and enduring. For the first time in what felt like ages, I let my limbs relax.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Warmth seeped into my bones, washing away the last tremors of the transformation. I watched the flames curl upward into the snowy sky, their golden tongues flickering in the dark eyes of the Gorons who now regarded me not with suspicion, but with respect and quiet camaraderie.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">It felt like family. Not the kind born from blood, but forged in silence, in danger survived, in promises made beneath sky and stone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Elder Boromu shuffled to my side, settling onto a carved stone seat with a low, gravelly grunt. He didn’t speak right away. Just stared into the fire with a heaviness in his eyes that matched the snow-laden skies above.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"You came to us in the middle of sorrow, child," he said eventually, his voice a rumble that seemed to shake loose the snow in the trees. "And gave us hope. But I must know—who are you, truly? What path led you from the land of chaos to this moment, here, now?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I nodded solemnly, the fire's warmth banishing the doubt in me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">And I told him everything.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The words poured out of me—not rehearsed, not crafted. Just raw and real. My journey through the forest, the ambush, the Skull Kid’s cruel laughter and twisted jokes, the curse that reshaped my body and severed my ties to home. I told him of the Ocarina I had lost, the time I had stolen back when I reclaimed it, the southern swamps where I had found rot and horror, but also healing and beauty. I spoke of my struggles with Lukhan, a crime boss in Clock Town, of my time with Ratt, and how we found his son. And finally, I mentioned my fear of losing the flickers of myself I still wasn’t sure I’d recovered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu listened with a heavy stillness, only his eyes moving in the firelight, glinting like slow-cooled lava. When I finished, he leaned in, placing a stone-weighted hand on my shoulder. It was solid. Grounding.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Loss never becomes easier,” Boromu said softly, his eyes reflecting a lifetime of grief. “But we, the Draumorim, carry each other's burdens. That is the true strength of the mountain. That is why Darmani trusted you, even beyond death.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">"You are no longer a stranger to us, Link of Hyrule," he continued. "You are Draumorim now. You have earned the name </span>
      <span class="c30">Rohmar</span>
      <span class="c23">, in our tongue—Stonebrother. And the mountain will remember you. Take peace now and know you are safe, with us, Rohmar Link."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Something uncoiled in my chest. Rohmar. It settled into me like it had always been there, hidden beneath the noise. Not a title. A truth. The Draumorim began a deep, rhythmic song of acceptance around me. The very earth quietly vibrated with their sound, and in a way it was deeply comforting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I smiled. It was small. It was weary.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">But it was real.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The chant around me resonated deep into my bones, not just a sound but a heartbeat shared among many. It thrummed low and ancient, as if the mountain itself remembered my name now. The firelight danced across the stone faces of the Draumorim—faces no longer wary, but open, grounded, proud. I caught Tatl’s quiet shimmer from the edge of the circle. She didn’t speak. She didn’t need to. Her light pulsed once, steady and warm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">And for the first time since leaving Hyrule, the emptiness inside me filled with something new, solid, and warm: belonging.</span>

    </h1>
    <p class="c18">
      <span class="c23"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I was mostly asleep—half-dreaming, half-floating—wrapped in the smoky warmth of my dinolfos cloak, when I heard, or more like felt it: the sound of heavy, deliberate feet crunching against the frost-bitten earth. Slow. Measured. Getting closer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">My eyes snapped open, instincts coiled tight. I sat up fast, breath caught in my chest, scanning the dark perimeter of the Draumorim’s grove. For a fleeting moment, I forgot where I was. Everything felt too quiet. Too still.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The fire had burned low—just a cradle of glowing embers now, pulsing like the last heartbeat of a sleeping dragon. Their red light danced across the snow-dusted clearing, casting long shadows across the stone bodies of the Gorons slumped nearby. From where I sat, they looked less like people and more like statues—hulking shapes etched from iron and stone, motionless in the heat-flicker of dying flame. Their stone-skin backs glinted faintly in the low light: some like weathered cliffsides, others marbled with veins of dark copper and grey quartz, each scar a testament to the harshness of the mountain’s love.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The silence was so complete it almost rang in my ears—until the sound of footfalls returned. Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The largest Goron warrior, who had captured me earlier, emerged from the treeline, his figure sharp against the dark—massive, shadowed, his breath huffing in misty plumes. He didn’t speak. Only dipped his head and moved directly to Boromu, his boots sinking deep into the frost-laced earth with each step. Even the rocks seemed to tremble as he passed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu, seated like a boulder worn smooth by time, turned to hear him. The brother leaned in, whispering something too low to catch. The elder’s brow furrowed, as if the mountain itself had shifted beneath him. No words passed his lips, but something ancient stirred in his throat—a low chant, gravelly and deep, that rolled out across the camp like a tremor echoing through stone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">At once the camp began to wake.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Two more Gorons appeared at the tree line, dragging a stiff, snow-dusted figure between them. Human legs trailed through the powder, leaving a wavering trail. The shape stumbled and twisted, trying to push back against the Gorons’ iron grip, even as his strength faltered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">And then—when the flicker of firelight caught tangled, familiar dark hair, my heart stuttered as recognition hit me—relief flooded through my limbs, chased immediately by a fresh surge of worry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Ratt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">He looked like he’d clawed his way through a storm—his cheeks raw with windburn, lashes crusted in ice, lips split and tinged blue. He wore a large, poorly fitting cloak that was torn open at the shoulder, exposing pale skin beneath, and his unprotected fingers twitched with the onset of the cold. His black boots were coated in snow, laces dragging, one of them half-untied like he’d been running until he collapsed. But the moment Ratt saw me, his posture shifted. Just a little.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Despite everything, a crooked grin tugged at the corner of his mouth, wild and stubborn.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Well," he muttered through chattering teeth, eyes locked on mine with exhausted relief, "so much for stealth."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Before I could respond, Boromu’s faded blue eyes flared like tinder struck by flint.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Ahhh... more human treachery," the elder growled, his voice thick with pain. "Here to steal my son again as he slumbers in cursed dreams?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">He pointed a finger at Ratt’s chest—thick, stony, accusatory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"No more. You won’t harm us again, human. Bury him in the earth, brothers. Let the dirt consume his deceptive mind."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I was on my feet before I could think, heart slamming against my ribs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Wait—wait, he’s with me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The Gorons paused. Tension thickened like steam in frozen air. One warrior, towering with arms like granite pillars, growled low.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Spies are not brothers. They bring ruin to kin."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"He’s not a spy…" I stepped forward, planting myself between Ratt and the circle of stone. "He wouldn’t hurt us. He came for me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu’s voice was slow and seismic, but clear. "If the Stonebrother vouches for him... then let him speak."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The Gorons hesitated, then finally released their grip. Ratt stumbled and brushed himself off, teeth chattering.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Thanks," he muttered to me, quieter now, almost sincere. Then louder, with his usual edge, "Look, I wasn’t spying. I was following."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Why?" I asked, arms crossing—part irritation, part bracing against the cold. "I told you it was too dangerous out here!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Because you’re in danger. Again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">He rubbed his arms, pacing a slow, uneven circle on the frosted ground. His boots crunched faintly with every step. "Lukhan’s still after you. He remembers something went wrong… not the details, but the feeling. That you cheated him. And now he’s losing his mind over it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">My stomach clenched, a cold knot twisting deep inside.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"I overheard some of his thugs talking about it," Ratt went on. "They were drunk and extra loud. He’s offering a huge bounty for anyone that finds you. Doesn’t even know why—just needs to get you alone and 'rip the answers out,' they said."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">A ripple of growls rolled through the camp. The Draumorim bristled. Some stood slowly, their massive hands clenching into fists, the tension thick in their wide, armored shoulders. One Goron’s eyes flared like embers stoked by wind, while another’s nostrils flared sharply, teeth bared in the beginnings of a snarl. The older warriors, the largest among the group, exchanged hard glances, the kind that spoke of scars and battles already fought. Even those who remained seated stiffened, their backs straightening like pillars bracing for impact. The youngest among them, an adolescent about my size who had stuck by Boromu's sleeping son like a personal guardian, gripped the edge of the cart a little tighter. His jaw set tight, mirroring the hardened expressions of his elders as though instinctively taking on their fury.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Ratt held up his hands slightly, voice dipping. "He thinks you’ve got something. Power. Magic. He’s hunting you with everything he’s got. Him and every dog he keeps on a leash."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl hovered to my side, her glow hardening. The embers cracked behind us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The cold felt suddenly sharper.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Look—you can’t go back to town, I can’t go back to town. They’re hunting all of us, Link. It would be far safer if we traveled together." Ratt’s voice was quiet but steady, more reasoned than pleading. It made sense. It made too much sense.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Hagh… fine," I muttered, my breath fogging in the dim air. "You can come. But you have to stay out of any fights if we get into any. I can’t—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The words choked in my throat. Darmani’s loss still carved deep, like a wound that hadn’t scabbed over. I could still feel the pulse of his last memory echoing through the mask strapped at my side. The thought of losing Ratt too—another soul brave enough to stay close—was almost unbearable. Because if I lost him too, I wasn’t sure there’d be anything of me left worth saving.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">My voice softened, brittle around the edges. "I just don’t want you getting hurt."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">He didn’t reply. But he looked at me in that way he sometimes did—sharp eyes, intelligent, as if seeing straight through all my defenses. It unnerved me more than any enemy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I turned my gaze skyward. The horizon had begun to shift from obsidian to slate, a dark grey hinting at the promise of dawn. The stars above flickered faintly, the last holdouts against morning. Time was pressing in on all sides. If Lukhan really was hunting us, it wouldn't be long before our presence here put the Draumorim here at risk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">No more needless death. No more hollows filled with snow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"We should pack up," I said, turning to Elder Boromu. "Move out to the mountain. Is your son awake yet?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu’s massive shoulders sank visibly, grief pulling at him like heavy stone. His voice lowered, rumbling with old pain. "No… he still slumbers. I had hoped that returning him to us—returning him to me—would be enough. That hearing my voice would stir his soul. But alas, he and Darmani were bound tightly. He cared deeply for the boy. The silence has been long."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu’s gaze drifted to the mask at my side—Darmani’s carved visage still locked in a roaring defiance against death itself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Perhaps," Boromu rumbled slowly, "he will respond to you… while wearing Darmani’s power?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Ohhh no, we’re not doing that again!" Tatl darted between us like a spark, her wings a blur of frantic energy. Her glow pulsed with urgency, casting flashes of light across our faces. "We almost lost Link last time! I don’t care how much Darmani meant to the kid—what if she doesn’t come back next time? If Link dies, the whole world is lost, what then?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu raised a gnarled, stone-scarred hand, a slow gesture meant to calm more than command. He nodded gently.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Be at ease, little sprite. I hear your worry, and I share it. There is another way—one we intended to try before my son was taken from us."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">But I didn’t answer them right away. My hand had already drifted to the mask at my hip, fingers brushing its carved edges, feeling the cold weight of it pulse faintly through the palm of my glove. The mask throbbed like a second heartbeat—dormant now, but waiting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">There was power in it. Not just strength, but certainty. When I wore it, the world made sense in brutal, simple terms. Enemy. Obstacle. Path. It dulled everything else—the fear, the guilt, even the fragile threads of identity that still held me together. I didn’t have to feel the things that confused me. I didn’t have to remember what I’d lost.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">But I also didn’t feel </span>
      <span class="c30">myself</span>
      <span class="c23">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I remembered how the thoughts had slowed, the words becoming fewer and further between. How my limbs had moved without hesitation, but also without nuance. It had been like sinking into stone. Comfortable. Heavy. And terrifying.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">I stared down at the mask, its eyes empty and wide. Darmani’s courage was still in there—I knew that. His honor. His grief. But so was the threat of losing </span>
      <span class="c45">me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">And the worst part? A small, traitorous part of me wanted to give in again. Just for a while. Just to stop feeling so damn much. It was terrifying, how much I wanted to lose myself again, to escape into strength that asked no questions and demanded no truth. The mask promised oblivion, a soothing void where fear and confusion couldn’t follow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I swallowed hard and tore my hand away, as if the mask had burned me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"There has to be another way," I said quietly, not meeting Tatl’s eyes. "There has to be."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu’s expression didn’t change, but something softened behind his eyes. A flicker of understanding. Or maybe… respect.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">His voice grew quiet, touched with sorrow. "Our home has a sacred place… a chamber of awakening. It is a quiet hall built into the heart of the mountain, a place for meditation, for communion with the spirits and the breath of earth. When Darmani left to confront the Divine Beast, my son—Maro—fell into a deep slumber. Grief weighed heavily on him, and the loss of Darmani was like a mountain falling on his heart. One of our reverend Elders suggested placing him in the chamber, where the mountain's spirit might guide him through his sorrow."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu’s gaze darkened. "But before we could seal the chamber, the thief struck. While Maro slept in mourning, defenseless and alone, he was stolen from us."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">He turned, his eyes sweeping across his gathered kin—each one standing silently, fists over hearts, heads bowed to the past.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">With renewed resolve, he faced me once more. "If even in the sanctuary of the grove we are hunted and tormented, then there is no point in pleading to the world beyond. We will do as we always have—solve our own struggles, protect our own blood."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">He lifted his chin. "Brothers, gather your gear. We return home. This time, we will be victorious—or we will be extinguished with the rest of the world."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The response was wordless but immediate. In a flurry of motion both swift and quiet, the camp stirred to life. Great packs were hoisted, carved tools and prayer stones wrapped in cloth. One of the Draumorim rolled slowly through the fire pit, quenching the last embers with a hiss and a gust of ash, leaving behind only the faint warmth clinging to the stones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I shivered as the heat fled the grove with the embers being extinguished. Snowflakes caught on my lashes. My breath curled in the air like smoke.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Turning, I stepped closer to Ratt, who was still pulling his cloak tighter with trembling fingers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"How… how are you feeling? Do you need anything?" My voice came out gentler than I meant it to. "You look half frozen to death."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">He gave a crooked smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes as he shivered. "I’ve been worse. B-but if you have a s-spare magic coat in your pocket, I won’t s-say no."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I couldn’t help but return the smile, heart softening at his resilience—even beneath frost and fatigue, he still found a way to joke. That stubborn, crooked humor of his had a way of piercing through the cold. I looked down at my gloved hand where the enchanted ring still rested, faintly pulsing with a dormant heat. It hadn’t been tested much, not really—but something about it always felt alive when I was in danger.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I hesitated, quietly watching the Draumorim move around with disciplined precision. What if it hurt him? What if I couldn’t control it? The thought of fire engulfing and consuming his skin made my stomach twist—but the way he shivered, the way his breath came in ragged clouds, I knew I had to try.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I focused my will into the ring, steadying my breath. At once, it flared to life—its jewels sparking with sudden crimson light, like coals catching flame.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Here," I said softly, offering my hand. "Take it. Maybe this ring will help warm you up? I’m… still not sure what it does. But I hope it doesn’t incinerate you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Haha—I’d take b-being set on fire over having my arms rattle out of their sockets."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Ratt reached out slowly, his bare fingers trembling as they brushed against mine. The moment he made contact, I willed warmth into him—gently, intentionally. The ring pulsed, and a trail of soft red flame curled upward from our joined hands, licking across his arm in a ribbon of glowing heat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">He yelped and pulled away instinctively. The flames vanished with the broken contact, and he stumbled back a step, eyes wide.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">"Y-you know," he stammered, examining his unscathed arm, "I was </span>
      <span class="c30">kidding</span>
      <span class="c23"> about the fire thing! Are you sure this is safe?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"No idea," I admitted. "Did you get burned? If you did I'm sure one of th-"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"No, no—actually... It feels great." He interrupted, looking over his arm in amazement, and then grinned as if remembering a fond moment in the past.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Like when I got to take a real bath once. A hot one. Gods, that was the best day of my life." He chuckled weakly and waved off my concern. "Let’s do it again. Seriously."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I exhaled in relief, letting the tension ease from my shoulders. Once more, I pressed my intention into the ring, and again the red flame unfurled—dancing over his arms and shoulders like a shawl of living warmth. This time, he didn’t flinch. The flames didn’t burn—they glowed softly, casting golden-orange light across the snow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Ratt stopped shivering. His breath no longer came in shudders. He stared at our hands in awe, his expression uncharacteristically quiet as the fire licked gently around him, warming him from the bones outward.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">He looked up at me, and for a moment, didn’t speak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The cold wind still whispered across the clearing, but between us, there was only the hush of firelight and shared silence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I felt that warmth blooming in my chest again, the flutter of keese attacking my guts, and I pulled away with a disconcerted gasp. Why did this boy always make me feel like this? What was wrong with me? My pulse thundered in my ears, my throat dry. Why did this moment—this quiet intimacy—unravel me more than any danger? Why did I crave it even as I fled from it?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">It wasn’t just nerves. It wasn’t just fear. It was something far more dangerous—</span>
      <span class="c45">hope.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Hope that someone could see me through this cursed form. That someone could hold onto who I was even as I unraveled. And that hope was painful. Because every time I felt it, it reminded me how far I’d already drifted from who I used to be. From the hero I once was.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The warmth around Ratt faded when I pulled my hand away abruptly, the glowing tendrils of flame shrinking and vanishing like a dream ending too soon. He blinked in confusion, his expression turning soft with concern.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"What happened? Are you ok?" he asked, voice gentler than I expected.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">"I’m… fine. It’s nothing." I forced my tone flat, the softness retreating as quickly as the heat. I didn’t trust it. I didn’t trust </span>
      <span class="c30">myself.</span>
      <span class="c23"> "Are you warm now?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">He rubbed his arm, eyes still on me. "Y-yeah? I’m ok now, heh… well should we…uh, get going?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">But his voice faltered. Not from cold this time, but something quieter—something searching. His gaze lingered longer than it should have, scanning my face as if trying to read a language half-forgotten. There was hesitation there, barely veiled; a pull he didn’t yet understand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">His eyes—those sea green, intelligent eyes—betrayed something deeper than curiosity, or confusion… beneath it all was a glimmer of fondness. Maybe he didn’t know what it meant yet. Maybe he hadn’t figured it out himself. But it was there, just behind the way his breath caught when our hands met, the way his shoulders had dipped not just from relief, but something softer. Something warmer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I turned away before either of us could speak, trying to bury the heat still curling under my ribs. My ponytail caught on my bow and I flung it behind me angrily.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">He didn’t understand. How could he? He didn’t know what it meant to lose everything you were, to lose your face, your body, to feel your mind slowly slip away. To want someone and be terrified of being really seen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">And goddess help me, the way he looked at me—like I was still just </span>
      <span class="c30">me</span>
      <span class="c23">—was more dangerous than any curse. I couldn’t give in any more to this, I needed discipline, order, willpower. I had to keep myself whole before losing everything I was, or else this world would die along with everyone in it… including Ratt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">So I rushed away—too fast, too sharp—pretending I had something urgent to do, anything that could excuse the sudden heat rising behind my eyes. The tribe was already mostly packed, but I threw myself into movement anyway, half-heartedly checking bags and stomping down snow, needing the distraction like a shield.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Stupid… stupid, what am I doing…” I muttered under my breath as I kicked at a pile of powdery snow gathering on a young sapling. My voice cracked at the edges.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl floated up beside me, her wings humming low. "Link, what’s going on? Did that kid say something to you? Do you want me to smack him around a bit?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I jumped a little—I had almost forgotten she was there. Her tone was sharp, but beneath it, I could hear the flicker of worry. The white fairy’s wings trembled midair, and she darted in close with a soft chime.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"No… he… urgh… nothing happened," I said, too fast. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">My throat tightened. My fists clenched so hard my knuckles ached. It was easier to lie than explain the fire curling under my skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"I’m just… frustrated. With losing Darmani. With having another cursed form shoved onto me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">My hand gripped the Goron mask hanging from my belt, my fingers curling tightly around its jagged stone edge. I let the pain bite into my fingertips. It was easier to blame the mask—this heavy, unfeeling thing—than admit what was actually burning under my skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">In truth, I was grateful for it. Grateful for the strength it gave me. Grateful for the way it buried my emotions under slabs of stone and muscle. It was like armor I could slip into whenever the world asked too much of me. Whenever I was afraid. Whenever I felt too much.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Especially now, when feeling too much might be the most dangerous thing of all. It left me open, weak, unfocused. I was so tempted to press the cold stone to my face and bury myself beneath a mountain of strength—let the sheer weight of that other body shield me from this trembling self I barely recognized anymore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Who was I even trying to protect anymore? Myself? Ratt? This world? The lines were blurring. I used to know what I was. A swordsman. A hero. A man tempered by fire and steel. Now I was none of those things—just a ghost flickering between forms, between faces. And the mask… the mask didn’t ask questions. It only obeyed its nature. It didn’t ask who I was becoming. It didn’t care.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Link, I know all this is… hard. But you’re not alone, you know?” Tatl’s voice was softer now, brushing against my thoughts like a hand reaching through the dark. “You don’t have to carry this by yourself this time.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Despite her brashness, the gentle hum of her wings felt like a steadying hand, reminding me quietly that I wasn’t alone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">"You’ve basically got a whole </span>
      <span class="c30">army</span>
      <span class="c23"> of Gorons who’d probably die for you. And that kid... as annoying as he is... nearly froze to death just to warn you. That has to count for something."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Her words pressed gently into the hollows of my chest, but they didn’t fill the space. Not yet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I didn’t respond at first. My eyes followed the Draumorim as they moved methodically around the grove, sweeping away traces of their presence with branch and stone. The fire was buried. The tracks smoothed. But it was like trying to erase footprints from wet clay. The signs were still there if someone knew how to look.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">And Lukhan </span>
      <span class="c30">knew</span>
      <span class="c23"> how to look.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I rubbed at my temple, the tension in my head blooming like a migraine behind my eyes. I didn’t want to feel any of this—grief, fear, longing, hope. But it clung to me like snow melting down my spine.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">My hands trembled, just a little. The kind of tremble you only feel when you know you’re standing on the edge of emotions that could unmake you.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“I… know that, Tatl. Thank you.” My voice came out rougher than I wanted. "I’ll be okay. I promise. Don’t worry about me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">A lie, again. But I needed to believe it long enough to move.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Let’s just get to the mountains and stop this cursed winter. I’m sure Boromu would let Ratt stay with them too, if I asked. That way we could finish healing the world like that mask salesman said, and I can end this curse without worrying about him getting hurt. At the end of this maybe then I can finally go home to where I belong."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The words tasted strange. "Home" no longer had a shape.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I paused, my breath misting in the quiet air, caught in the brief silence before the next storm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"I’ve learned my lesson..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">But even as I said it, a part of me whispered back:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c45">Not enough.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The words echoed like footsteps on frozen stone, distant but unrelenting. I shoved them down, deep, where they couldn’t bloom into doubt. Not here. Not now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu had stepped beside me—quiet, steady—his presence like the hush before snowfall. I hadn’t noticed him approach, but his scent carried earth and ash, and the quiet gravity he held was as familiar as the mountain itself. How long had he been standing there? Had he heard everything?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I hated that thought. But he gave no sign that he had, offered no judgment. Instead, he only looked ahead and motioned to the shadowed treeline, where the snow gathered like a breath waiting to be exhaled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Rhomar Link,” he said, his voice a low rumble of ancient stone, “the path ahead is the direction of the mountain. If we are to make it to Draumor by nightfall, we must begin the journey. I fear this snow will only slow us down further… but we will follow your lead. Let Darmani’s spirit guide you, and you will find your way home.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Home.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I nodded once, the word once again stinging more than it soothed. I scanned the camp—the Goron brothers were ready, solemn and quiet, their preparations finished. The fire pit had been flattened and brushed over, the snow swept clean, but still, the earth held memory. Tracks too wide to hide. Evidence of life that would not be erased by branches alone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I looked toward the trees and found Ratt standing apart from the group, leaning against a frost-laced trunk. His arms were crossed, but his gaze was fixed on me with quiet worry. I met his eyes for half a breath—then looked away before either of us could speak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Okay. Let’s start moving, my brothers.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">My voice came out flat. Cold. Like iron hammered into a blade. Resilient. Or at least pretending to be.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The sky was bleeding into a pale, bruised violet, the color of old sorrow. Dawn crept up slow and silent, veiled behind clouds thick as wool and heavy with warning. A storm was coming—we could all feel it. The cold was sharpening, not easing. The quiet pressed down, too complete to trust. Even the snow, which drifted in gentle spirals, felt like it was holding its breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I raised my hand and signaled forward, stepping beside Boromu as the caravan began to move. The Draumorim followed in silent rhythm, a procession of living stone, their footsteps heavy but sure. The cart carrying Maro rolled behind us, the boy still curled in his deep, silent sleep, guarded by the youngest of the tribe. The sight of him—so small, so still—sent a quiet pang through my heart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The cold deepened as we walked. Flurries stung my cheeks like tiny needles. I reached for the mask at my side. Its surface was cold to the touch, but the promise of strength beneath it pulsed faintly like a heartbeat in stone. The mask didn’t ask who I was. It didn’t care what I felt. It just gave me something to be that wasn’t... this. The rough, carved edges dug painfully into my palm, a welcome distraction from the ache tightening my chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I could wear it, become the mountain again—lose myself inside its silence, where nothing could touch me. Where love and fear and longing could not follow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">But no. Not yet. That strength came with a cost I could no longer afford to pay casually. I needed to stay present. I needed to remember who I was.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Ratt kept his distance, trailing behind the group near the cart. I caught glimpses of him chatting with the young Goron pushing it—light words, a half-smile, shoulders hunched against the cold. He laughed once—short, uncertain. Like a bird chirping trying to join the flock, but not quite finding its place.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I turned away quickly, pretending not to notice, pretending it didn’t echo in the hollowed-out chambers of my chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I pushed my boots harder into the snow, let the cold bite deeper, welcomed it. It kept me sharp. It kept me focused.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">No more distractions.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Just the mountain. Just the path ahead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The trail bent upward, narrowing into a slope choked with crooked pine and half-buried stone. Trunks lined either side like ancient pillars, their bark laced with frost, their branches heavy with snow. The wind had quieted for now, but I could feel it waiting. Breathing. Watching. A presence, not just a pressure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The only sound was the crunch of feet in powder and the distant creak of trees groaning under winter’s weight. Somewhere above, a hawk cried out—sharp, brief, and alone. The sound pierced the stillness like a blade through cloth, then vanished into the hush. Light filtered down in slanted beams, pale and cold, gilding the ridge in silver and sorrow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">It would have been beautiful, if it didn’t feel like the mountain was holding its breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu walked beside me in silence, his great frame moving with a kind of reverent stillness. His breath steamed out in low clouds, curling around his beard. Once, he glanced skyward and murmured something beneath his breath—low and gravelly, like earth remembering its dead. A prayer. Or a warning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I didn’t ask. I didn’t need to.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Behind us, the Draumorim moved as one—quiet, solemn, their feet sinking deep into the growing snow drifts. Their shapes looked carved from the mountain itself, but even they carried tension in their shoulders now. The silence between us wasn’t peace. It was vigilance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Ratt trailed behind, near the cart, wrapped in cloak and uncertainty. His steps were steady, but his eyes never stopped moving. Once, I felt his gaze brush the back of my neck, but I didn’t turn. I couldn’t. Not now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">As we crested the next ridge, the world unfurled beyond the tall pines.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Mountains loomed in every direction—towering cliff faces, sweeping ravines, and jagged peaks dusted with snow like ash on old bones. The mountains looked like the ribs of a giant laid bare to the cold, as if the land itself had died and we were marching through its remains. Dawn had arrived, but the sky wore a deep slate gray, heavy with brooding clouds that shed flurries like whispered curses. The air was thinner here, and the light diffused through the snow-heavy veil, softening the world into something dreamlike.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">What lay before us was breathtaking, even in shadow. This place held a kind of sacredness, a hush woven into the ridges and slopes. It felt older than time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Far below, forests of pine and spruce blanketed the foothills like sleeping giants. Their emerald needles were crusted white, boughs bending under winter’s weight. A wide valley opened beneath us, and at its edge roared a mighty waterfall—its cascade disappearing into a cloud of mist that billowed like a dragon’s exhale. The water glittered with an inner light, carving silver lines through the landscape as it fed the winding rivers and creeks that stitched through the forest beyond.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">It was beauty carved from stone and breath. Alive, yet silent. Harsh, yet beckoning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu stood beside me, his voice a gravel-smooth murmur over the wind. “Our home is just up those falls, Rhomar Link. There is a great hotspring at the heart of the monastery. We call it Vah Kel'Darah. In the Hylian tongue, it means Sacred Life from the Mountain Deep. From it, the mountain breathes. The warmth keeps our home alive—our crops, our young, even the old ones who dream beside it.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">His gaze darkened, jaw setting like a landslide. “But this cursed winter creeps deeper with every hour. If we do not stop Goht, even Vah Kel’Darah will freeze… and with it, all we built will vanish.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The Draumorim had begun their descent into the valley, broad backs bent slightly against the chill wind. Their silhouettes moved slowly, like migrating stones. I lingered at the ridge, my eyes still locked on the beauty below—the frozen rivers, the breath of mist, the distant plume of smoke curling up from a lone cottage far out in the trees.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I understood why they chose this place.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">They came from fire and ash, death and destruction. But here, there was water. Motion. Abundance. A mountain that breathed and gave life.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Ratt’s approach broke the quiet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“H-hey, Link,” he said gently, voice careful, eyes searching. “Are you okay? Did… did I do something to upset you?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">His words were hesitant, but earnest. Honest in a way that pierced the frost I’d layered over my thoughts.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">It stung—because he truly meant it. He truly wanted to help. And it would have been easier if he didn’t.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">That only made the feelings twisting inside me more intense. More impossible. Like a vine of warmth trying to grow in frozen ground.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The kind of feelings that weren’t supposed to take root in someone like me. Not a hero. Not a sword. Not a mask.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I couldn’t meet his eyes. My breath fogged between us, caught in a gust of wind that scattered the flurries like ash shaken from a dying hearth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“No,” I said, too quickly. “I just need to concentrate on my task. Don’t worry about me, ok? I’m fine. You just focus on staying alive.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">My voice was cold, clipped. Sharper than I meant it to be. I turned away before I could regret it, falling into step beside Boromu.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c46">
      <span class="c23">“Right… sure,” he mumbled, clearly hurt but quickly masking it with a forced smile.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I caught his smile out of the corner of my eye—but his eyes… they sank. Like he’d just swallowed something bitter. My heart clenched, then turned away. I didn’t want to feel that guilt. I didn’t want to feel anything at all.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The snow thickened in the air around us, as if the mountain itself had taken notice. I pulled my cloak tighter and walked faster.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl flitted beside my ear, voice low. “Hey Link, you sure you’re okay?” she whispered, settling onto my shoulder. Her tiny hands braced against my collar. “I mean I’m all for ditching him, but he’d probably die out here alone. You want me to tell him to scram anyway?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“No…” I whispered back, watching the fog of my breath melt into the wind. “I don’t want him to freeze to death. He’s… fine.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I glanced back once. Just once. He was still walking, hands tucked in his sleeves, shoulders hunched against the wind. Alone, but not by choice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“I just have to keep my mind sharp and focused,” I said softly. “Not worrying about his safety is all.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">But the truth clung to my heart like the frost clinging to everything here. I was already worried about him. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">We continued on our way down into the valley in a single file, the leader being the largest Goron, who I had come to know as Gromi. The further we traveled into the valley, the more uneasy the atmosphere felt. The wind rose sharply, tearing through the trees with renewed force, carrying with it a whisper of ancient sorrow—a warning, or perhaps a prophecy of what lay ahead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The flurries thickened with every step, whirling in spirals that bit at our faces and buried the trail behind us. The sky had vanished into white, and the wind howled with the voice of something ancient and relentless. I could feel the mountain shifting, watching, as if it knew we didn’t belong here. The sky bled into a bruised violet, the color of old sorrow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Somewhere ahead, Boromu raised his arm and pointed to the rising smoke of unseen warmth curling faintly into the storm. Shelter—if we could reach it in time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">And behind me, through the veil of snow, Ratt’s form trudged forward—smaller than he had seemed before. But still there. Still following.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The silence felt like a breath held in my chest—too long, too tight—waiting for the moment it would all shatter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c18">

    </h1>
    <p class="c18">
      <span class="c23"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">As we traveled down the slope, the wind started to blast us in waves of snow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">It didn’t rise gradually—it struck. Sharp, sudden, biting. Laden with frost and something older. Snow peeled from the trees in choking clouds. My cloak snapped against my body like a sail, the fabric clawing at my arms. I pulled it tight, heart pounding beneath layers of wool and dread.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The clouds above had changed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">No longer gentle gray. They churned with bruised violet and sickly steel, twisting like coiled serpents across the peaks. Thunderheads high above moved like predators, slow and full of purpose. The cliffs and jagged ridgelines were beginning to vanish beneath a crawling veil of white, their shapes dissolving into the white horizon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The blizzard was inevitable. No longer a threat—an arrival. We had to find shelter, and soon, or else we would all be buried under snow and ice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl darted beside my face, wings shimmering like shards of starlight, frantic and stuttering in the wind. Her voice trembled as she fought the gale. "Link... that doesn't look good."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I looked up. And in that moment, I saw it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">A wall of white—not mist, not fog, but solid wind—an avalanche of air and frost hurtling toward us from the far side of the valley like a colossal hand descending from the sky.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu stopped abruptly, planting his feet with the weight of stone. He lifted his head and let out a low groaning call that vibrated through the rising wind—a sound like ancient earth shifting in its sleep. The caravan of Draumorim paused, then moved with calm precision, gathering into a defensive circle around their elder. I shielded my face from the snow’s bite and pressed forward. The brothers parted the way for me, their expressions grim, as Ratt and Tatl stayed close at my back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“What do we do now? Should we find shelter?” I asked, my voice barely audible over the shrieking wind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu nodded, concern weighing heavily in his old, frost-lined eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“There is a passage…” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu's ancient shoulders slumped slightly as he spoke, as though the very weight of the mountain rested upon him. His voice was strong, but carried a deep sorrow—the choice he offered was one he had hoped never to make. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“An old proving ground—sacred to us. It was sealed when Goht began to rage. Monsters had found their way into the chambers, and Darmani was forced to seal the exit to protect Vah Kel’Darah from desecration. But the entrance lies here, in this valley. If we pass through it, we will reach Draumor—our monastery, our heart. Yet it will not be safe. I fear the creatures that claimed it still linger there.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">He turned to face me fully. “But with you—and Darmani’s spirit—guiding us, we have a far better chance in there than out here.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The snow angled sideways now, stinging like sand—sharp, blinding, relentless. Each gust was like a fist, knocking breath from my lungs and slicing at exposed skin. The snow bit harder than arrows, burying us slowly, mercilessly. My bones felt brittle, close to shattering. The horizon vanished beneath the storm’s veil, swallowed whole by white fury. Trees around us became ghostly silhouettes, half-seen phantoms shifting in and out of the swirling gale. The air itself was an assault, stabbing into my lungs with every breath, sharp as broken ice. It smelled of copper and cold iron—like blood on a frozen blade.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“That sounds w-way better t-than out h-h-here!” Tatl stammered, her glow dim as she dove into the folds of my cloak, wings shivering against my chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I could barely feel my fingers anymore. A deep ache had begun to settle in my arms and legs, creeping in like frostbite. I clenched my jaw and focused my will into the ring on my hand. The gem flared to life, and a sudden bloom of warmth spilled around me—soft orange flames licking over my clothes and skin without burning. It felt like being cradled beside a hearth, like the memory of a fire in the deepest night. I exhaled a shaking breath of relief and almost forgot about Ratt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“S-so d-do we have a p-p-p-plan?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Ratt stumbled up beside me, his voice ragged from cold. His face was red from windburn, lips cracking, breath huffing in pale clouds. I stepped slightly closer, letting the heat from the ring spill toward him. He didn’t lean in—but I felt the way he eased as it reached his side.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“We’re going to pass through some caves, I think. Right, Elder?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu nodded slowly, his great brow furrowed beneath a growing crust of snow. The Draumorim had formed a tight cluster behind him, massive bodies huddled together like boulders weathering a storm, their faces turned to me—not with doubt, but with weight. Expectation. Trust.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“We will pass through the Flame Hollows, brothers,” Boromu intoned, his voice steady against the wind. “A path once sacred—now deadly, and sealed. But today… it opens again. Rhomar Link will protect and defend us.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The expressions of the large and imposing Gorons that surrounded us were taut with unease. I could see the flicker of hesitation in their eyes, even among the most stalwart of them. This was no ordinary path—it was one they had deliberately sealed away, a wound in the mountain left to fester in silence. But now, with the blizzard bearing down like a beast from the heavens, there was no other path forward. Only in returning to that place of trial could we hope to survive.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">With a grim nod from Boromu, the Draumorim moved forward as one. Their discipline was swift, practiced—born of centuries surviving a world that was rarely kind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Gromi, take the lead. You know where the entrance lies here!” Boromu called out over the roar of the storm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The burly Goron who had apprehended me the night before grunted, stepping to the front of the caravan with grim purpose. He unwound a thick coil of rope from his travel pack and secured it tightly around his waist. Without words, he passed the other end to the next brother in line, who did the same. One by one, the Gorons formed a living chain—binding themselves to one another in a silent pact of survival, no one would be left behind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The brothers encircled us, shielding us from the worst of the wind. I felt like I was inside a massive turtle shell, protected on all sides by stone and willpower. Their faces were drawn tight, breaths misting in the freezing air. Even the hot-blooded Gorons were shivering now, their volcanic cores no match for this unnatural chill. It made my stomach twist, knowing that if I failed my brothers would die slowly by freezing to death.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I was endlessly grateful for the ring—its warmth was more than comfort. It was life. Without it, I could feel my own bones locking up, my joints going stiff. Within the enchantment’s embrace, a soft orange flame curled outward like a hearthfire wrapped around my form.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl had taken refuge inside my cloak, her tiny body tucked beneath the layers near my back. I could feel her faint weight riding against the hero’s mask I carried there—our strange and terrible burden.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">But Ratt… he was still shivering. Violently. His lips were pale and his jaw clenched as he trudged forward beside me, teeth audibly clicking.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The heat didn’t reach him. Not fully. The magic clung tight to me alone. My pride fought me, even then—as I wrestled with my emotions, but I looked at him, saw that he was suffering. Ratt’s breaths came in ragged clouds, his shoulders hunched painfully inward as if the very air were knives pressed against his skin. Each step looked painful, every breath a wince. I swallowed the tight knot in my throat and offered my gloved hand to him. He blinked, surprised, his expression softening as he hesitated. Then, wordlessly, he took it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">His fingers were ice. But the moment we connected, I pulsed will through the ring again—extending the warmth outward, willing it to encompass him as well. A bloom of orange light flared softly around us, like sunrise caught in snowfall. The warmth surged through the air between us, wrapping us both in a protective veil. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Ratt inhaled sharply, relief flooding his features. His shivering slowed. The tension in his shoulders eased.  As the gentle flame spilled between us, I felt more than warmth—I felt connection, a tether of golden heat binding us together. The glow rippled softly, matching the rhythm of our intertwined breaths, as if the ring itself recognized our closeness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Around us, the nearest Gorons felt the warmth too, leaning subtly inward. Even Boromu stepped closer, his stone face tilting slightly toward the glow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">For a moment, there was no storm. Just warmth. Just breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I didn’t let go of Ratt’s hand. But the moment my stomach started to twist again I steeled my willpower and looked forward, hardening my resolve to see us safely through the mountain. If there was going to be a fight, I needed to be ready… not distracted like an idiot.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">We kept moving through the intense howling wind, one foot at a time, the rope between the Gorons tugging like a lifeline in the whiteout. My cloak snapped around my legs, my boots nearly vanishing beneath the snowdrifts, but finally we saw it—a stone archway carved into the cliff face, half-buried beneath a mantle of ice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The group disengaged the circle with practiced ease, tightening formation into double file as we approached. The entrance loomed above us like a waiting maw, its teeth formed by icicles hanging thick from the arch. But the way forward was sealed—entombed in a thick wall of solid ice that shimmered with a pale blue light, nearly opaque and hard as metal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu stepped forward and placed a heavy hand against the surface. Frost spread beneath his palm. “The breath of the mountain has stopped here,” he said, voice heavy with quiet reverence and sorrow. “Only strength and stone may undo what has been silenced.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The storm howled behind us, the snow slashing like knives at our backs, but for a moment, all was still. I stepped closer, eyes tracing the runes carved faintly into the frozen arch. They pulsed softly, barely visible beneath the ice, like a heartbeat slowed to the edge of death.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl peeked out from my collar, her wings brushing my neck. “You’re not seriously thinking of putting that mask on again, are you?” she said, half a whisper, half a plea.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“I have to.” I kept my voice low, not looking at her. “There’s no other way.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">There was a wingbeat of silence, then a flicker of movement as she flitted around to face me. Her glow was sharp, her wings a blur in the bitter air. “You almost lost yourself last time! Do you really think it’s worth the risk?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu’s gaze settled on me—deep, patient, sorrowful. “Only you can choose, Rhomar Link. But the mountain must breathe again… or we will not survive the night.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I reached down, my fingers brushing the jagged stone of the mask at my belt. It was cold, but pulsed faintly with something deeper—something ancient. I could feel Darmani waiting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl's wings buzzed frantically, shimmering with a fragile, anxious light. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Please, Link…' she pleaded softly, voice tight with genuine fear. 'Come back to me this time. Don’t lose yourself again.'</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“I’m still me,” I said quietly. “I’ll come back. I promise.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl hovered in front of me, silent now, her light dimmed to a faint glow. I met her eyes for just a moment. Hurt flickered there, raw and unguarded, but she didn’t stop me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I took a breath—deep, sharp—and pressed the mask to my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Pain. Heat. Weight. But not like before. The agony was there, yes—but muted, familiar now. A rhythm my body had begun to remember. Like pulling on old armor and letting it fuse with muscle and marrow. The rush of stone wrapped around my limbs, thickening me, grounding me. My thoughts dimmed, simplified. Not dulled. Focused.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Strength returned.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I felt it in the creak of my spine, the swell of my chest, the tightening of fists like boulders. I opened my eyes, and the world answered with silence and weight. Every sound deeper, slower—like I’d fallen into the breath of the mountain itself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The warrior stood again. And I knew what I had to do!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I stepped forward, the earth groaning beneath me, each footfall cracking frost like eggshell. I roared—low and resonant—and slammed my fists into the frozen gate. The impact shook the stone around it. Cracks spiderwebbed instantly, veins of light against ice. I struck again. And again. Until the wall screamed and shattered, shards exploding like crystal rain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">From the breach came warmth. Real, living warmth. It rushed over us like a sigh from a sleeping volcano—sulfur, smoke, iron. The smell of something ancient and sacred.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The Flame Hollows breathed, fighting back against the frozen gusts behind us like an army unleashed against its enemies.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Behind me, I turned just enough to see Tatl hovering, her light dimmed and hesitant. Her tiny form trembled—not from cold, but something unspoken. Her voice didn’t come. Only silence, small and echoing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Ratt stood beside her, snow clinging to his lashes and shaggy black hair, eyes wide—not in fear, not in surprise, just… almost in awe. Seeing a true Goron must be a real reward for that kid!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Let’s move,” I rumbled, my voice now carved from stone. “The mountain breathes again.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Inside, the air changed immediately—still freezing, but no longer biting. The wind no longer screamed. It was a breath held in stone, ancient and waiting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The cavern swallowed us in silence. The only sound was the crunch of boots and stone-shod feet against the frost-veined path. My footsteps echoed dully, like the mountain was listening.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Blue crystals lined the walls in fractured veins, their glow faint but alive. They pulsed dimly in rhythm, like a heartbeat long buried beneath the earth. The light shimmered against the frost-clung stone, cold as moonlight and just as distant. When it caught the frost, it turned the whole passage into a corridor of ghosts.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The path beneath us bore the memory of reverence. Curling etchings danced across the floor—ceremonial designs now half-swallowed by grime and shattered rock. This had been a sacred place once. I could feel it in the weight of the air. In the way sound refused to rise above a hush, and yet there was something vibrating...calling almost into my very bones. A song of passage, a stonesfeel of home... </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">But whatever else it once held had been violently stolen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Deep gouges tore through the stone—long, chaotic, angry. The claw marks of something fierce. They didn’t follow the flow of the path—they slashed across it, as if the thing that made them refused to respect its purpose. Scratches scarred the walls, some blackened with soot, others split by weapons or other tools of destruction. The smell of scorched minerals lingered faintly, beneath the dust and smoky ice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">My breath puffed in great plumes as I moved. Each inhale filled my chest with the cold weight of history, and something else—something darker. Not a memory... A warning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl drifted beside me in silence now, the edge of her glow brushing faintly against the crystals as we passed. She said nothing. Perhaps she understood it too: that this wasn’t just a cave. It was a place that remembered being holy. And I resented what had been done to it. The enemy would pay with broken bones and split necks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I tightened my fists. My arms no longer ached. My legs no longer trembled. The mask had made my body strong.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">But even stronger was the pull to protect this place. This mountain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Let the monsters come.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I would meet them with stone and fire.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Yeeeah… I don’t like this," Tatl muttered at my side, her voice tinny and uneasy. "This place puts me on edge. It just feels like something is waiting to ambush us… Link, don’t you think you should take that mask off now?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"No," I rumbled, slower this time. "I like it. I need it, Tatl."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre1">I pushed forward with forceful strides, daring anything in the dark to try me. My shoulders rolled with power. I would defend my brothers. I </span>
      <span class="c30">was</span>
      <span class="c23"> the mountain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Ratt’s voice crept up behind me, low and cautious.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"This is the proving ground filled with monsters?" he asked, scanning the gouged cavern walls. "Well… at least this place is somewhat warm."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I hadn’t even noticed. It was warm—but something felt wrong. Like the dying embers of a once roaring inferno. The rock under my feet was solid, grounding. Good. But I still felt the wrongness. It was as though the mountain’s heart was locked in a quiet battle—its sacred pulse faintly whispering beneath the dark corruption that smothered it. The very air felt like a prayer gone unanswered, a temple forgotten by the gods.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">My brothers fell in line behind me as I walked the path forward. Several of them removed glowing crystal rods from their packs, illuminating their paths forward in the dim light. They were just as uneasy, their faces stretched with worry and fear as their heavy footsteps synced with mine. The fairy and the kid followed too. The glow ahead was red—firelight. But something inside me knew this place was sick… not right.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">We walked for a time. The quiet thrum of heat hummed through the floor, through my feet, through my bones. I listened to the vibration… felt pulse of mountain. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Would crush enemy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Eyes forward, smash threat…</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">And then—</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Link, take that mask off now! It’s been too long!” Tatl shrieked suddenly, darting in front of my face. “You’re losing it!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Her voice stabbed like a jolt. I blinked. Slowed. The world felt… dimmer somehow. Heavier. But her wings shimmered like memory. My fingers twitched toward face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Wrong. Something was wrong. The fairybug was right… I was too deep. Not safe. Take off. I reached up, gripped my beard.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">And pulled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The transformation ripped through me like being cracked open by a hammer. Stone sloughed from my body in an unseen avalanche. My limbs shrank. My chest caved inward. My thoughts flooded back in a rush, tangled and sharp. Pain flared through my whole body as if it had imploded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Uughnn… that… that didn’t feel great…” I choked, collapsed onto my hands and knees. My breath came out in shudders.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The air remained cool, but the heat beneath my palms surged like buried embers—too raw, too alive for bare skin to hold.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu’s voice called out, echoing faintly through the corridor. “Rhomar Link, are you well?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I pressed a hand to my chest, feeling it rise and fall like a stranger’s. The heat throbbed against my skin. My heart thundered in my ears.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“I-I’m… uhh… I’m fine, Elder,” I managed, my voice thinner now. “Just… trying to get used to it, is all.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I tried to stand. My legs were weak. Ratt was already there, his hands around my shoulders, grounding me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Easy,” he whispered, worry on his breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I steadied myself, shook my head once, scarlet hair whisking from my vision, and gently tapped his hand to remove it from my shoulder. He let go too quickly, as if afraid he’d done something wrong. His face darkened with guilt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I looked away, jaw clenched.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c30">Idiot, </span>
      <span class="calibre1">I cursed myself</span>
      <span class="c45">. I am an IDIOT.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The mask beckoned me like an old, dangerous friend as I placed the stone features on my belt, next to my Hero’s Mask—comforting in their familiarity, seductive in those promises of strength without pain. But every heartbeat echoed with Tatl’s fear, reminding me how easily I could lose myself, swallowed whole by the mountain’s fury or a warrior’s pride.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The others caught up to us, the ground quivering as they drew near. The stony faces of the Draumorim softened slightly as they watched me, their gazes filled not only with expectation, but quiet reverence—acknowledging the sacrifice, and silently promising to share the burden. Boromu shuffled in with his cane making solid thuds on the stone, parting through the line towards the cart with his slumbering son. The young Goron who stood at my height, pushed the cart more easily now across the smoother cavern floor towards the Elder, though his wide eyes betrayed his fear. The crystal glow painted his cheeks in soft blue as he glanced around the darkened chamber, clearly uneasy. He had probably never set foot in the Flame Hollows before.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Tumar, has Maro stirred?” Boromu asked gently, his voice as tired as the wind dying within the gate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“No, Elder… he has been as silent as the mountain,” Tumar answered, his tone subdued. His voice lacked the gravel and depth of the older warriors, but it carried a quiet strength of its own.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“I feared so…” Boromu murmured, his gaze lingering on the boy sleeping in the cart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Around us, the others were catching their breath, their broad shoulders rising and falling like bellows. Many leaned against the cave walls, eyes closed, arms slack. The imminent threat of freezing to death over, the silence of the corrupted halls was beginning to seep into their bones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu turned slowly to me, his heavy footsteps echoing against the etched floor. His faded eyes held both worry and weariness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Rhomar Link,” he said, “we must rest. We will need all of our strength for the trials ahead. I fear the mountain’s heart grows still beneath Goht’s corruption. And I sense… we are not alone here.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">A tremor passed through his voice—small, but it reached me. Even Boromu, ancient and tempered as he was, felt it: the presence that lingered, like a wrong note echoing through sacred halls.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Up ahead,” he continued, “there is a chamber of meditation, used by our young as the first rite to connect with sacred Snowhead. We can seal ourselves within. It will offer sanctuary to rest in peace.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">He lifted his cane and gestured down the corridor, his expression solemn.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“We will stop there for a time. Regain our strength. As we are now, we are no match for the shadows that stalk these halls.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I nodded, grateful for the pause. My arms ached from the weight of my form, and the hunger gnawed at me like an echo in my gut. . I vaguely wondered if I was able to eat rock as in Goron form—or if I’d even want to try—but the thought passed quickly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">We pressed onward.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The silence in the halls deepened with every step, broken only by the soft rattle of wheels and the distant hiss of cooling lava veins. The mountain no longer roared. It whispered. And the whisper was wrong.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The passages widened into vast, echoing caverns veined with molten arteries. But what should have been a roaring forge of life felt... wrong. I could feel the heat—yes—but it was uneven, unfocused. Not a broiling heart of a mountain… but something strangled. Something decaying.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Rivers of once-living lava crawled in sluggish streams along the channels, their surface crusted in flaky obsidian scabs. The color was all wrong—no fierce gold, no blazing red. Only a muted, muddy orange glimmered through the fractures. The veins pulsed faintly beneath the cracked stone like a heart trying to remember how to beat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">It felt like walking through the ribcage of a god that had recently stopped breathing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Boromu furrowed his brow, placing an ancient hand on one of the walls. His stone-scarred fingers brushed the blackened surface, reverent and mournful.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"This place once roared with heat," he muttered grimly. "Now it fades like a dying heart. The corruption reaches far here… even the breath of Vah Kel’Darah grows shallow."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Behind us, the Draumorim walked slower now. Their proud frames dimmed by something more than weariness—grief. Their gaze wandered not forward, but upward, to the stalactites and carved reliefs that once marked this as sacred ground. The loss wasn’t just physical—it was spiritual.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Even Tatl said nothing. She drifted onto my shoulder like ash on cooling coals, her glow dimmed. She didn’t fidget. She didn’t tease. She only rested there, quiet and watchful.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Not far now. We will rest at the next chamber. Let’s move, my brothers. Time for mourning will come later," the elder sighed, a long landslide of a breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I swallowed the tightness in my throat and pressed on, taking the lead again. Sweat beaded on my temples, but I didn’t complain. I welcomed the heat, no matter how strange it felt in here. It was better than the strength-sapping blizzard outside. It felt… earned. If nothing else, it reminded me I was still alive. Still moving.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The shadows danced against the walls with every ripple of failing magma. Somewhere deep in the rock, I thought I heard it—like a groan. A low, vibrating sorrow. The kind of sound stone makes when it’s trying not to break.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">As we passed under a steep archway with a familiar symbol of an eye and teardrop carved above it elegant, flowing lines. That symbol had always meant hidden truth, sacred witness. But here, it felt like a cry frozen in stone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">We ran into a solid obsidian door, flawless and lightless, absorbing the flickering glow around us. Elder Boromu took out the sacred Eye of Truth from his waist satchel, his hands steady despite the tremble in the air. He held it up to his faded vision, the lens catching the light in a single flash. After a moment of searching, he placed his ancient hand on the smooth obsidian.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">A pulse. A soft ripple of blue light shimmered outward from his palm like water disturbed in a bowl. With a low, resonant grinding of stone against stone, the door began to rise, vanishing into shadow above us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The air inside shifted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">It was cooler in here. Not the life-giving warmth of fire, but the heavy, dormant pressure of something long buried. The walls arched into a high dome, and the ceiling had been carved and painted with faded murals—spirals of snow and ice, rising flame and heat, figures of Goron pilgrims bowing before the mountain. Life flowing abundantly in a continuous arc from the heart of the mountains. On top of a the tallest peak stood a lone figure of an animal... yet not quite animal. It almost looked like a machine or statue of a four legged beast of burden. A quiet reverence lingered here, dulled by time but not yet erased.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">In each corner of the chamber stood what looked to be Sheikah Stones, but larger—shaped like seated Gorons. Their broad shoulders and thick arms were stylized into the stone itself, each one wearing a mask adorned with the Eye and Teardrop. But the shape was different—sharper, angular, echoing Goron craftsmanship. The ancient alliance made manifest in stone. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">These statues almost felt... awake.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">There was a sense—just beneath hearing. A pulse in the rock. The silence here was not mere quiet—it felt sacred, mournful, like a held breath in a room of silent prayers. The stone walls, etched with memories of devotion, seemed to whisper softly of hope still flickering, though buried deep beneath sorrow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“We will rest here, Rhomar Link,” Boromu said quietly, as if speaking too loudly would disturb the slumbering spirits carved into the stone. He turned, eyes shadowed. “Gromi, take Korozi and Belgor, and ensure the doors ahead are sealed.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Yes, Elder.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Gromi—the towering brother who had once dragged me into their camp—grunted low and signaled two others. Without a word, they moved into the corridor beyond, the glow of their crystals bobbing like will-o'-the-wisps before vanishing into the dark. The sound of stone groaning shut came soon after, echoing like a distant memory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I let out a breath I hadn’t known I was holding. The stillness was thick but not dead. It was watching.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“It is done, Elder. Korozi, set up camp, everyone gets rations.” Gromi’s voice rumbled low like rolling boulders. He turned toward me, his face weathered but earnest. “Rhomar, it may not be very tasty for humans, but we do have a type of bread that you both may be able to stomach if you are hungry. It’s important that you all keep up your strength. The path only gets more brutal ahead. Especially for a human.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">My stomach gave a sharp pang at the mention of food… I must have been far hungrier than I realized now that we had a moment of peace and safety.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Thank you,” I said, bowing my head slightly. “I’m sure your food will be just fine. I appreciate the generosity.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Gromi nodded once with a quiet grunt and turned to help the others. The Draumorim moved with quiet efficiency—despite their size, there was grace in how they handled the space. Belgor unrolled thick hide mats from a weathered pack, each marked with geometric red-and-black patterns. Korozi, stocky and broad-chested with an intricately braided beard ringed in bits of obsidian, tended to a small campfire built within a carved stone basin, stoking it with chunks of slow-burning coal that hissed faintly as they caught. The air smelled of mineral smoke and warm earth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tumar hovered near the cart, his young face tight with anxiety. He kept stealing glances at the mural above, then back to the older Gorons, his posture stiff with the pressure of expectation. Though his limbs still carried the weight of youth, he held himself as tall as he could, as though his spine alone could carry the honor of the tribe. Maro remained as still as a boulder in the cart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl poked her head out from my cloak, her glow dim but steady. "That bread better not be made of rocks. I swear if it cracks my teeth, I’m going to scream."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Ratt let out a soft laugh, wiping any frost that lingered from his cheeks and hair. "After that hike? I’d chew a tree stump if it came with salt."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Haha Tatl, you don't even eat! Why would you care?" I laughed and gave her a playful tap with a finger.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Hey I eat! You just never notice. I don't need as much as you huge lumbering humans." Tatl rolled her eyes and pushed my finger away gently.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I smiled, the weariness briefly softened by their banter. A portlier Goron named Dolmi—his arms tattooed with silver spiral bands and his eyes almost comically large—handed out dense, clay-colored loaves from a leather pack. The scent was earthy and faintly sweet, like roasted chestnuts and ash.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Ratt took his with a skeptical glance. "Looks like a rock. Smells like a rock. Here goes nothing."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">He bit in—and blinked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Okay that’s… not bad actually. Kinda nutty. And spicy?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Mountain pepper-root," Dolmi rumbled helpfully. "Grows in the ashfall. Warms the chest."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Tatl took a hesitant nibble from mine, then widened her eyes in surprise. "Well, paint me surprised. Not bad for boulder bread."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I settled down beside Ratt on one of the thick hides. Heat curled around us in gentle waves, cocooning us momentarily in a peaceful, almost sacred hush.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The Gorons moved slower now, exhaustion beginning to catch them. Gromi sat against the far wall, arms crossed, his heavy lids fluttering as if in meditation. Korozi rubbed at his knees and murmured something in a rhythmic chant, the words low and ancient, like stones grinding underwater. Even Belgor, stoic and thick as a gatehouse, took a seat and traced an old carving on the stone floor with a calloused finger, lost in thought.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">In the corners of the room, the ancient Sheikah-Goron effigies still watched, their silent masks reflecting the firelight and crystal rods with a dull gleam. Faint vibrations still hummed from within them—steady, patient, as though waiting for someone to speak the right word.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I watched them. This wasn’t just a rest—it was mourning. This place, once sacred, had been defiled. Their silence wasn’t just tiredness. It was grief. A quiet vigil for something they all felt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I decided to take a chunk of the hard loaf. The crust cracked apart like a soft clay brick, flaking gently in my gloved hands. The inside was dense—spongy like moss and a deep volcanic gray. I took an experimental nibble. Surprisingly, it was tasty, with a hint of oaky spice and a slow-burning heat that bloomed across my tongue. I took a bigger mouthful, and my stomach growled in gratitude. The bread was heavy and tough, almost like dried meat, and every chew fed something deeper than just my body. It reminded me of hearth smoke and old forest bark—simple, honest things.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Beside me, Ratt had gone quiet. He chewed slower, distracted, then began to hum.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The tune floated gently out of him, soft and sorrowful—a lullaby woven from glass and elegance. Each note drifted like currents in still water, brushing against the edges of memory like wind through an old curtain. It was beautiful in its simplicity, ancient in its grace. My breath hitched, caught on the edge of recognition.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I knew that melody.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Not the name. Not the shape of it. But something inside me stirred—like a memory half-frozen, beginning to thaw.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I turned to him, my brow furrowed. "Where did you learn that song? It sounds… familiar. What is it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">He blinked, startled by the question. "Oh. Uh… I dunno, actually. It’s just… been in my head since yesterday. Just lingering in the back of my mind... You know?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I nodded slowly, the ache in my chest returning, I felt like I was forgetting something vitally important.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Interesting… I swear I’ve heard it before… somewhere…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Ratt looked down at the bread in his lap. His fingers were still now. He spoke more quietly, like he was speaking to himself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"It makes me feel… sad. Like this place. Like something old was lost here. I don’t know why, I just… felt like it was right to hum. Like it belonged here. Something royal and noble to sing into this place."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I swallowed the lump in my throat with another bite of bread. "Sing it again," I said, voice hoarse. "Please. I don’t know why, but… it’s calming. I need to hear it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">One of the brothers passed around a large heavy stone flask, and I took it with both hands and swallowed a mouthful of pure, fresh spring water. I passed it to Ratt, and he smiled with a flicker of something solemn behind his usual smirk. After a few swallows of the revitalising water, he began to hum again—this time louder, surer. Each note lingered like a quiet echo, curling gently around memories buried too deep to face. I felt the ache of her absence, the gentle sadness of a goodbye left unfinished. The lullaby wrapped around me, soft as snowfall, warm as tears. The Draumorim turned their heads, listening with eyes closed, reverent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The sound moved through the chamber like water rippling upward. It didn’t just echo—it filled the space. Sank into the bones of the stone. A melody of peace, but not without pain. It felt like starlight in winter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">A name surfaced in my mind. Just barely.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">When Ratt finished, he let out a breath and whispered—barely audible, but I caught it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Zelda."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">My hand froze. My entire body went still.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Wait," I said sharply, turning to face him fully. "How do you know that name?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Ratt’s eyes widened. "What name? Zelda?" He hesitated, clearly uncertain. "I… don’t know. I just think of that name when I hear that song. It fits. Like a memory trying to come through a fog. Why, who is Zelda? Do you know them?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">My mouth went dry. I looked into the flickering firelight and saw her—not her face, not exactly. Just the shape of what we’d shared. The ache of walking away from it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"She…" I paused, searching for words that didn’t exist to describe how I was feeling. "She was a princess I once saved. We were close. Maybe more than close. But I chose to leave. I couldn’t—" I faltered. The truth was heavier than I expected. "Ugh… nevermind. It’s in the past."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Ratt looked at me carefully. Not with pity. Just understanding.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"You… couldn’t be satisfied in a time of peace," he said gently. "There was too much pain."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The words hit like a hammer to the chest. My eyes widened—not in anger, but in raw, unguarded shock.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">How could he see that?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">He shouldn’t have been able to. Not unless… he felt the same way somehow?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The firelight flickered between us, casting long shadows that danced across the ancient stone walls. Around the chamber, the low murmurs of the Gorons had faded into the hush of rest, but between me and Ratt, something raw and electric still lingered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I looked down at my hands—slender, with fine wrists and graceful fingers, delicate in a way that I still wasn't used to. The fingerless brown gloves clung tightly to my skin, worn and weathered from the road. A Hero... That title meant less and less with every step into this frozen, cursed land. But somehow—here, now—his words made it feel less like a wound and more like a scar. Something that had bled… but was now starting to heal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">For a breath of a pause, I couldn’t speak. The fire crackled softly beside us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">And for the first time in a very long while, I felt like someone finally understood.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">"Y… yeah," I finally whispered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">It was all I could say.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">And somehow, in the echo of that quiet, it was enough.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The heaviness of the chamber and memory weighed on me, and I took a final bite of my portion of Goron bread, chewing it in silence. The flavor lingered—smoky, nutty, warm. It clung to my mouth like the heat of the fire still radiating from the center of the room. I held it there, letting the comfort settle as if to anchor me in the now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Alright, well if you two are done making out, I’m gonna get some sleep,” Tatl grumbled in irritation, fluttering off my shoulder in a blur of white gold. She curled into a glowing ball on the nearest bedroll, her wings twitching faintly like the last flickers of a firefly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I frowned at her, exhaling with a slow sigh. The weight in my chest hadn’t lifted—if anything, it had simply rearranged itself. I swallowed the last of my bread and rose to my feet, moving toward the bedroll beside her. The stone beneath me felt colder now, even with the chamber’s residual warmth pressing into my skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I wasn’t tired. Not even close. The memory had shaken me loose. My mind was racing with too much I couldn’t untangle—anger, longing, sorrow, fear. All of it mixing in my blood like coals refusing to die out. This meditation chamber, carved for peace and self-reflection, only amplified what I was already carrying. It didn’t soothe me. It made everything louder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">“Yeah, that’s a good idea. I haven’t slept in days, it feels like,” Ratt said quietly after a long pause. His voice was softer than before, worn down by the day. He stood, brushing crumbs from his gloves, and walked slowly to a bedroll farther off.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">I watched him go. Just for a second. I didn’t want him to leave. I wanted him beside me—to feel his warmth again, to borrow just a little of the steadiness he always seemed to summon. But the pang of guilt twisted deeper. Anger followed it, and I shut my eyes hard against both.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">No. Not now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">We were still in danger. This place was still corrupted. And sleep—even restless, haunted sleep—was something I had to force if I wanted to stay strong enough to keep him... us... alive.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">So I lay back on the hide mat, my bare fingers curling against the stout leather, and willed myself to stillness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">The chamber sighed around us, deep and old.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c23">Somewhere beyond these walls, the mountain slowly died in silence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c18">
      <span class="c23"></span>
    </p>
