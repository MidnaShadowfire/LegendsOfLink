      <span class="c14">Ambush</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The swamplands grew darker and more oppressive as the day died slowly, suffocated beneath a sky of muddy orange and bruised violet clouds. The sunset was smothered completely, hidden by thick stormbanks that loomed in the distance. The deluge promised that morning had never come, but its absence felt like a curse rather than a mercy. Distant thunder rumbled low across the horizon, a constant growl that never ceased, as if some vast beast circled just beyond the horizon, patiently stalking us, waiting for nightfall. Still, the air hung heavy and soured—dense with the stench of algae, molded rot, and something deeper that filled my lungs with dread. Breathing it in made my throat itch. It felt like the swamp was trying to get inside me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl and I picked our way along the marshy shoreline, boots sucking into damp earth that squelched and gurgled with every step. The buzzing of insects that had plagued us earlier began to fade, replaced by a sinister hush. Birds, too, had gone silent. It wasn’t peaceful. It was the kind of silence that animals used to warn each other that a predator was near. I tried not to dwell on it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Frank, the strange but hospitable tour guide of the boathouse, had told us of a Magic Shop somewhere further down the bank. According to him, the shop owner’s sister was likely still there and might have the key to the locked boat. We followed that hope. Tatl drifted close to my shoulder, veering away from the more toxic patches of marsh, her gaze darting restlessly into the mist-choked trees as if expecting them to move.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"What if we run into Odalwa on the way to the magic shop? It was bad enough to look at in broad daylight, and I certainly don't want to be grabbed by the monster!" Tatl flitted about nervously, startling at every movement within the mists.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Don't worry about it, we'll just hide like last time. If it can't see us, then we'll be just fine." I offered a weak grin. "Worst case, I throw you at it and run."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Excuse me?! I am not bait! I am a dazzling orb of wisdom and guidance! You throw me at a monster and I will personally haunt you in every temple from here to Termina Field."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"See? You’d make a great distraction. Loud </span>
      <span class="c16">and</span>
      <span class="c8"> glowy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I joked lightly, but a brief pang of guilt twisted in my chest at her glare. Truthfully, I’d sooner fling myself into danger than risk her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl huffed and glared, but the glow around her pulsed a little warmer, less frantic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Frank said the shop isn’t far," I added more gently. "We’ll be there soon."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"He also said people like you were Odalwa's favorite victims. You know—small, brave, tragically stab-happy types. And it’s getting dark… what if it sneaks up on us and kidnaps you like the others?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I highly doubt that a big monster could sneak around so easily. Plus, I’ve noticed my hearing’s a lot better since... well, you know." I tapped my temple. "New ears and all..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Oh perfect. So we’ll </span>
      <span class="c16">hear</span>
      <span class="c8"> it coming before it eats you. Great comfort."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I tried to keep my tone light for her sake, but truthfully, her fear was starting to creep into my own bones. The longer we walked, the more the shadows seemed to shift and breathe around us. My gut was twisting with unease, a wordless signal screaming from the same primal place that made the animals flee before a storm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Hrrmm ok...if you say so. You're the warrior here, not me. I suppose you'd know the situation best." Tatl took a deep breath and blew it out slowly, as if trying to physically push her nerves down. "So... I wonder what happened to the boat lady. Do you think she got taken, like the others?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"I hope not," I muttered. "We don't even know where they're being kept. Plus we really need a boat here. I wouldn't </span>
      <span class="c16">dare</span>
      <span class="c8"> swim in that stuff!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Even thinking about it made my skin crawl—murky water thick with algae, debris, and who-knew-what corpses bloating under the surface.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"If she was kidnapped, then there's apparently no way we can get a boat, and we'd be stuck. So please, don't jinx it for us."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I'm just saying... we should have a backup plan or something…" Tatl grumbled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Ugh... fine. I guess you're right." I sighed. "Keep an eye out for anything we can possibly use as a raft. There's gotta be driftwood along the banks we can lash together. But stay away from the treeline—if I were a monster, that's where I'd be lurking."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">We scanned the banks as we walked, our eyes flicking between patches of reeds and half-sunken logs, the last slivers of daylight fading fast. The air was still thick and warm, reeking of mold and death. When we rounded a bend in the lagoon, a sickly-sweet stench slammed into me like a blunt weapon. I gagged and glanced around frantically, something was wrong here.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The water ahead had turned a curdled shade of purplish-brown, its oily surface slicked with bloated fish and bits of unidentifiable gore. The banks were mottled with black silt and flies, buzzing in lazy, grotesque swirls.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Uh, Link? I have a bad feeling about this area," Tatl whispered, barely audible against the dense silence. "Look at the water. Do you think... that thing could be nearby?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"It's a good chance," I said, scanning the treeline. My eyes caught a fallen log near the shore. "Quick, let’s take cover over there."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">We moved fast but low, instinctively hunched, every squelch of our boots in the muck sounding like a gunshot in the hush. I ducked behind the log while Tatl slipped inside my cloak like a trembling ember.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">For long moments we held our breath. Nothing moved.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I slowly lifted my head to peek. The lagoon had gone still, deathly still, as if even the wind had stopped breathing. Purple-grey clouds loomed overhead, reflected in the mirrored slime of the water. Algae clumped like floating bruises on the surface. Across the way, a thick copse of moss-draped trees hung in silence, their vines swaying just barely—as if something had brushed past them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c18">
      <span class="c8"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I peered into the trees across the stagnant water, straining my eyes for movement among the gnarled trunks and weeping vines. The air was still, sticky, and so thick it felt like it could be sliced. A sudden explosion of motion snapped my gaze upward—birds erupted from the canopy in a flurry of panicked wings, screeching as they fled from something unseen. The sound faded quickly, swallowed by the thick fog.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The swamp held its breath. Everything stilled to unnatural silence. Then came the footfalls—heavy, distant, rhythmic… Each one sent subtle tremors through the earth, vibrating up through my boots and into my bones. The lagoon's mirrored surface rippled with each impact, breaking apart reflections like shattered glass. My stomach knotted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I didn’t breathe. Didn’t blink. Just waited.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">With a splintering crash, Odalwa burst through the trees—its enormous form exploding into view like a nightmare made real. Its sword, jagged and grotesque, cleaved through low-hanging branches as if they were paper. Its body was painted in crude war markings, masked by a twisted wooden faceplate riddled with nails and carvings. It stomped to the water’s edge, its movements oddly stiff, like a puppet being jerked forward by invisible strings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Then it sniffed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Sharp, wet gasps sucked in through the slits of the mask, each one sounding like the gurgle of drowning lungs. It tilted its head left, then right, twitching with each breath. My blood turned to ice as its hollow eye-holes swiveled in our direction.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I ducked behind the log, heart pounding in my ears like a war drum. The wood was trembling against my spine with each of the thing’s steps. Tatl let out a tiny whimper inside the cloak, her glow dimming almost to nothing. I slipped a hand back to my belt, fingers closing around the mask. If it came closer—</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">A shriek split the stillness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">From across the lagoon, dozens of furious howls echoed, followed by a clatter of thrown stones. The monkeys. A chaotic barrage of screeching erupted from the canopy as rocks pelted the monster’s face and shoulders. I could hear them thunking against its wooden mask—sharp cracks and splinters flying.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Odalwa let out a guttural roar and spun on its heel, the sheer vibration of its voice rippling the water. It charged across the swamp in a furious, thudding sprint, crashing after the monkeys as they scattered into the trees like startled leaves.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I dared to raise my head. The log creaked as I shifted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Dozens of monkeys—mud-caked, shaggy, and wildly different in shape and size—were perched in the treetops, flinging anything they could get their hands on: rocks, fruit, even bones. The scene was primal and chaotic, but to my amazement, they were holding their ground. The liquid rot from its body spewed into the waters as the monster moved, and the monkeys retreated back into the safety of the woods.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">My hand trembled around the mask. That had been too close. One more second... one single misplaced breath...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">Tatl stirred faintly in my cloak. "That was </span>
      <span class="c16">way</span>
      <span class="c8"> too close."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Yeah," I whispered. "I noticed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">When everything was quiet and calm once more, we both breathed a huge sigh of relief.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"See? </span>
      <span class="c16">Whew</span>
      <span class="c8"> Not a problem," I said with a shaky laugh. "We could see it from a mile away! Totally under control."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl zipped out from under my cloak with a scowl. "You were about ten seconds from getting pancaked! If it hadn’t been for those monkeys, we’d be monster chow."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Well… maybe," I admitted, rubbing the back of my neck. "I could’ve transformed and taken a swing at it. Might be smart to put the mask on ahead of time next time."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Oh, perfect. Loud thumping and dramatic transformation sparkles in the middle of a stealth mission—great plan." Tatl zipped between me and the mask, glowing brighter in frustration. "Seriously, you’re not exactly Mister Subtle with that thing on."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Okay, okay! Point taken. But if we bump into Odalwa again, don’t expect a well-timed costume change."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">She sighed, drifting back beside me. "Let’s just </span>
      <span class="c16">not</span>
      <span class="c8"> bump into him again. Deal?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Deal."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">We trudged back toward the shore, following the murky lagoon, the last echoes of monkey screeches fading behind us like distant war cries. Whether they meant to save us or not, I owed them a debt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Twilight settled over the swamp like a burial shroud. The light drained from the sky, replaced by a hazy gray-blue gloom that seeped into everything—water, bark, skin. The whole world felt damp and grave-cold. Trickling streams bled into the main body of water—sickly green and black, oozing like veins across the mire, carrying with them strange slicks of iridescent oil that shimmered with unnatural colors.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">We passed bloated animal corpses half-submerged in the muck, their skin blistered and peeling, limbs stiff in death. Some had sunken eyes filled with maggots, others had mouths frozen open in silent screams. Flies buzzed in maddened spirals, thick enough to form clouds that dispersed only when we neared. Gnats bit at my face and neck, leaving itchy welts that throbbed with each heartbeat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Bones, long picked clean, jutted from the silt like broken fingers reaching for mercy—or perhaps warning us back. A stench of rot and chemical decay clung to the air, thicker than fog, crawling into my nose and mouth until I nearly gagged. Each breath felt like inhaling poison.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The ground squelched beneath our feet, soft and treacherous. My boot slipped once on a patch of black slime and I caught myself on a twisted root that oozed decayed matter the color of dried blood.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I pulled my cloak tighter, but it didn’t help. Nothing could. The swamp was death—slow, sticky, and inescapable. And it was watching us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c18">
      <span class="c8"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c18">
      <span class="c8"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Ughh.. I'm thinking we should just walk through the trees and forget following the shore! These flies are driving me </span>
      <span class="c16">nuts</span>
      <span class="c15">!" I hissed to Tatl, flailing at the relentless swarm buzzing around my face. They were in my ears, up my nose—one even tried to crawl </span>
      <span class="c16">into</span>
      <span class="c8"> my mouth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"What about the shop? Frank said to follow the shore—" Tatl ducked as I swatted at a particularly aggressive gnat. "Hey! Watch it! I do </span>
      <span class="c16">not</span>
      <span class="c8"> want to get knocked out by your flailing."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I turned to apologize—and nearly stepped on a decomposing goose. The burst of stench that hit me was immediate and vile.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Urghh—gross!" I gagged, leaping awkwardly over it. My foot landed ankle-deep in a patch of squelching, sour mud. "Oh COME on!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">Tatl winced as I yanked my boot free with a wet slurp. "That poor bird. How did it even </span>
      <span class="c16">get</span>
      <span class="c8"> here?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"No idea," I muttered. "But I'm done with this. Let's move over there—before I end up face-first in a pile of swamp meat."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I stomped toward the tangled treeline, boots squishing, cloak dragging muck. Tatl zipped after me, trying to escape the thickest cloud of biting insects.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"And what if we run into monsters back there?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Honestly? I’d rather deal with a monster than trip over one more dead goose."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"That’s a bold strategy. 'Death by bog beast' versus 'death by bird blunder.' Truly heroic."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"We’re probably near the shop by now anyway. Monsters don’t usually hang around where there’s signs of people... right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl glanced around the gloom. "This place hasn’t looked 'people-friendly' in a decade. But hey, if you say so, Hero."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Relax. We’ve got this. Just stay close."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Pfft...sometimes I wish I had your confidence," she muttered, landing delicately on my shoulder. Her wings drooped just a little. "But I guess after all the crap you’ve faced, a little murder-mud and monster-stench is nothing."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Well, once you've been sucked inside a giant whale, travelled through time, defeated the </span>
      <span class="c16">literal </span>
      <span class="c8">King of Evil, or changed into the opposite gender, I think you'd be surprised at what you can accomplish. At that point there's really nothing that can surprise you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl let out a genuine laugh. "Okay, fair. You’ve earned your swamp swagger. Maybe I’ll borrow some."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Just don’t borrow my boots. They’ve officially died."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Duly noted. I'm glad I can fly."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She flexed with a tiny hum, mimicking a bodybuilder pose. I snorted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Alright, tough girl. Let’s tone it down—I think I see something up ahead. Building-shaped. Maybe we’re finally close."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I ran to the carved wooden structure ahead, heart pounding with each step, trying to stay silent as the trees loomed like sentinels around me. The encroaching darkness made everything seem warped and surreal. The gateway before me was a strange burst of color in the gloom—etched with painted owls, foxes, and glowing symbols in vibrant reds and blues. Beneath it, a worn sign read: "This way to Kotake's Magic Shop, for all your mystical needs!" The arrow beneath the cheerful script felt almost mocking.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Well, I'm glad we're almost there. It's getting really hard to see out here, plus these flies are getting on my last nerves!" I slapped at my arm again, feeling the wet crunch of a crushed bug against my skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I couldn't agree more, I was about to say that myself… I'm being attacked from all sides!" Tatl flailed her tiny arms like she was drowning in a storm of gnats.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">We passed through the archway, and the air instantly grew heavier, wetter. The dirt path narrowed and twisted through choking underbrush, while moss hung like streamers from crooked limbs above. Somewhere to our right, an animal let out a guttural cry—abrupt, short, then silence. I paused. Tatl hovered close, glancing around with wide eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Probably just a wolfos," I whispered. "They hunt at dusk."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The light dropped sharply. What little sun remained was swallowed by the canopy above, casting long shadows that shifted as though breathing. Tatl nudged my arm, pointing at something ahead—a flickering orange glow weaving through the dark trees.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Hey, what's that? You think it could be someone who needs help?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Umm, maybe... but we need to get to that shop."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Yeah but... what if they're in trouble?" She fluttered anxiously toward the treeline. "C'mon, let’s go see!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">A flash of silver blurred past us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">With a deafening crack, a tree exploded in front of Tatl, showering her in bark and splinters. She screamed. My instincts kicked in—just as a massive, gnarled hand lunged from the shadows toward me. The skin was stretched taut over blackened bone, riddled with fungus and oozing pustules. I barely twisted away in time, rolling into the wet leaves and dirt, heart stuttering.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Odalwa. Again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I bolted behind a tree as the ground shook beneath the thing’s steps. Tatl zipped upward, her glow panicked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Link! Watch out!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The monster’s massive blade carved through the air, slashing through vines and trees as if they were tissue. It moved with terrifying purpose—this wasn’t a wild swing. It was hunting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I dove behind a bush as the sword cleaved my previous hiding place clean in two. Wood detonated in splinters. Leaves shot upward in a burst of green and brown. The very air seemed to recoil, buzzing with static and the scent of burning rot. A guttural wail—inhuman and primal—rattled my bones, deep and resonant, like the cry of something ancient and wrong.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Then I saw its face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The mask’s eyes turned toward me—twin voids of pitch black, bottomless and lightless, pulling in every flicker of the world around them. They weren’t just empty—they were devouring. Shadows bent toward them. My heart seized.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Black ichor oozed from the corners of the mask like tar-slick tears, dripping steadily onto the moss and hissing where it landed. Thin veins of fungus pulsed along its surface, glowing faintly like embers under skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">It didn’t see me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">It </span>
      <span class="c16">sensed</span>
      <span class="c8"> me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">No time to transform.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I wrapped trembling fingers around my bow, notched a magic arrow, and aimed through the foliage. The faint glow lit up the brush—too late.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The creature's head snapped in my direction. It roared, louder than thunder. A wall of sound and fury.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">And it charged.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I tried diving away back into cover as Odalwa charged toward me, flinging broken trees every which way like a tantrum of nature itself. One of the soaring trunks clipped me in the left shoulder, and the impact exploded in white-hot agony. I screamed, a raw and guttural sound, as my body twisted midair and slammed into the ground. I hit hard, my lungs seizing up, my vision clouding. Pain exploded through my shoulder in searing white-hot waves, each breath agony. My vision blurred with tears, limbs unresponsive, useless. Terror surged, bitter and choking. I had never felt this vulnerable—this powerless.. Every heartbeat sent another lance of torment down my side.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The ground shook as Odalwa’s massive footfalls closed the distance. My heart thundered. I blinked away tears, mud clinging to my face. And then—</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">It loomed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The mask hovered inches from my face, steaming breath washing over me like a swamp fog from a rotting beast. The stench made me gag—sour, fungal, and metallic. Black ichor dribbled from its jaw, sizzling where it hit the earth. The hollow eye sockets stared into me—those unnatural voids that swallowed all light, all hope.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">My limbs refused to move. My shattered shoulder sent waves of paralysis through me. My good hand scrabbled weakly at the dirt, reaching for a branch, a weapon, </span>
      <span class="c16">anything</span>
      <span class="c8">. But I couldn’t escape.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Get away from me!" I shrieked, voice breaking with terror. I tried to slide back, but my body wouldn’t obey. My arm collapsed beneath me and I fell sideways into the muck.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The mask tilted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The monster reached for me—its twisted hands gnarled like dead wood, dripping with ooze, its fingers twitching like it could already feel my throat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">And then—</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She hurled herself in front of the mask, clutching a jagged splinter of wood. With a sharp cry, she drove it straight into the thing’s eye.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="calibre3">
        <img alt="" src="images/image5.png" title="" class="calibre4"/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The sound was unbearable. A screech tore through the swamp like a siren, rattling the trees and my skull alike. Purple liquid jetted from the mask’s eye socket, spraying in thick arcs that hissed when it hit the dirt and plants. Odalwa stumbled back, claws clutching at the embedded shard, convulsing in rage.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Tatl dropped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She fell limp, tumbling end over end until her tiny body hit the ground like a fallen ember. Her glow flickered erratically, fading.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Tatl! Tatl, are you—</span>
      <span class="c16">gasp</span>
      <span class="c8">—okay!?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I dragged myself toward her with my good arm, each movement a scream inside my nerves. Twigs tore my skin. Vines tangled my legs. But I didn’t care.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She was lying in a nest of debris, her little limbs trembling, her face smeared with that same grotesque purple ooze. Her breaths came in short, shallow bursts—barely there.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Tatl! No, no no no—stay with me! Come on! Please!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I reached out and cradled her tiny body in my palm, feeling her weak pulse through my dirty fingers. She didn’t respond.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I sobbed, helpless. The swamp pressed in from all sides.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">“Tatl! Tatl, please—”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">My voice broke, raw with panic and grief. I cradled her tiny, trembling form gently, fear squeezing my heart like a vise. I could lose anyone, anything—but not her. Never her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Then—</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The ground thundered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Odalwa had recovered. It stood tall and furious, blade raised in a high arc. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t run. I had nothing left.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">It let out a roar—a bellow of hate and hunger—and charged.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I closed my eyes, clutching Tatl to my chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">And waited for the end.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">An icy blast of freezing air suddenly whizzed past my face, so sharp and dry it sliced the breath from my lungs. A thunderous </span>
      <span class="c16">thwomp</span>
      <span class="c8"> followed, shaking the ground like a boulder had fallen from the sky. I dared to crack one eye open.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Odalwa’s massive, decaying form lay toppled, now encased in a thick, crystalline coffin of ice. Frozen mid-lunge, its blade still half-raised, the monster let out muted, muffled groans from behind the frost, its limbs twitching just slightly beneath the surface. Steam hissed from the seams of the block as the swamp’s heat began to eat away at the edges, but for the moment—blessedly—it was trapped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Then she appeared.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The hag swooped in from the trees like a phantom wind, hunched low upon a crooked broomstick that left a curling trail of shimmering frost in the air behind her. Her robes were tattered and layered, adorned with glowing runes and stitched charms that jingled faintly as she moved. Frost clung to the hems of her sleeves. Her skin was pale green and wrinkled like dry leather, and a massive sapphire glittered from the center of her towering violet turban.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I blinked, dazed, something was familiar about her. Her presence buzzed through me like static, familiar yet distant—like a name on the tip of my tongue. Where had I seen her before?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">With a guttural rasp, she raised her gnarled hands—decked in silver rings and bright lacquered nails—and chanted something low and ancient. The ground beneath the frozen monster rippled with crimson light, then split apart like paper. A swirling vortex of red magic yawned open, its edges crackling with raw power.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Odalwa groaned again, its massive body trembling within the melting ice. With a sharp gesture and a hissed word, the hag completed her spell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The frozen brute sank into the portal without a sound. One moment it was there—the next, it was swallowed by the red void. The portal snapped shut with a hiss, leaving behind only curling steam and scorched moss. A surge of relief and awe washed over me as Odalwa vanished into the swirling portal, replaced by stunned silence. We had escaped death—barely, impossibly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">The witch exhaled through her nose, satisfied, and gave a brisk nod. The sapphire on her turban flashed. She turned toward us, muttering something unintelligible—something about </span>
      <span class="c16">reckless girls and unfinished errands</span>
      <span class="c8">—as she glided closer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">My body went limp.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">With the danger gone, all the adrenaline drained from me at once. The world swam before my eyes. The pain in my shoulder roared louder than ever. I tried to hold onto consciousness, but it slipped through my fingers like mist.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The last thing I saw was her boots touching the ground beside me, and a gloved hand reaching down, glowing softly with pale blue light. As darkness claimed me, I clung to a fragile hope that this witch—this savior—had arrived in time. Tatl’s small body still nestled in my palm was the last thing I felt as everything slipped away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c18">
      <span class="c8"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c10">

    </p>
    <h1 class="c25" id="h.hilwg54efcqi">
      <span class="c14">Toil and Trouble</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c7">
      <span class="c8">A dull ache radiated from my shoulder as I slowly regained consciousness, the throb of pain pulsing in time with my heartbeat. My body felt heavy, wrapped in fatigue, and the air around me was thick with a strange and spicy smell that clung to the warmth like smoke in an enclosed room. My limbs felt like they were submerged in warm honey, sluggish and uncooperative. I was lying on a soft mat, and heard the faint sound of bubbling liquid nearby—a rhythmic, soothing noise like a distant cauldron simmering with secrets.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Footsteps approached—soft, deliberate. Something warm and wet gently plopped onto my shoulder, followed by a tug as it was wrapped and secured. A spike of pain lanced through me, sharp and sudden, and I sucked in a gasp through clenched teeth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">My eyes flew open at the sting. The moss poultice pressed against my skin was warm and damp, its earthy, astringent scent blooming in the air like crushed herbs beneath a midsummer sun. I turned my head and tried to sit up, but a wrinkly, olive-toned hand pressed firmly against my chest, holding me down with surprising strength.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Stay there, you foolish child!" a voice croaked. "Your body’s still healing. No need to go flopping about like a fish out of water."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I stared up at her—the same ancient hag who had frozen Odalwa in a block of ice. Her skin was cracked and weathered like bark, eyes bugged and sharp as beetles. She leaned over me, peering at my shoulder like it was a misbehaving experiment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"My potions work fast, yes, but not </span>
      <span class="c16">that</span>
      <span class="c8"> fast. Hmph! You’ll be up and charging into danger again soon enough. You’re lucky I found you when I did, you know. Not every day I scoop a screaming girl and her twitching glowbug off my front lawn."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I opened my mouth to speak, but my throat was scorched and dry, like I’d been chewing Gerudo desert sand for hours.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"T-Tatl..." I rasped, barely a whisper.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">The witch blinked. "Tattle? Tattle on </span>
      <span class="c16">who</span>
      <span class="c8">?" she asked, squinting in suspicion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I shook my head weakly. "My... my friend. Is she—cough, cough—is she okay?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">Understanding dawned in her expression. She gave a grunt and waddled over to a cluttered table, rummaging among jars and flasks. "Ah, the fairy. Tough little puff of light, that one. Took a direct hit of Odalwa’s blood. Nasty, toxic stuff, that. But you’re lucky, you see—</span>
      <span class="c16">I’m</span>
      <span class="c8"> the greatest alchemist in all Termina! If anyone could save her, it’s me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">A knot of fear in my chest loosened just slightly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"She’s not out of the woods yet," the witch added, grabbing a clear flask filled with milky white liquid. "But she’s stable. Breathing. Needs lots of rest. So do you, by the looks of it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I watched her closely as she turned, the light catching on the rings decorating her gnarled fingers. My gut twisted with doubt. After everything, could I trust her? Was this kindness... real? Or something worse hidden behind her craggy smile?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">And yet, there was no real malice to her movements. Only practiced care. Purpose.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She returned to my side, holding the flask like a chalice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Here, drink this. It'll help to </span>
      <span class="c16">free</span>
      <span class="c8"> your parched tongue." The witch clucked softly, her tone lilting—but her grip on the flask was firm, insistent. She tilted the pungent substance to my lips without waiting for agreement.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The liquid was oddly sweet, thick with a flowery, perfumed essence that clung to my tongue. It tasted like violets crushed with honey and something faintly coppery beneath, like blood hidden beneath blossoms. As it slid down my throat, I felt the fire in my throat dim, the cracked dryness replaced with a soothing coolness. It relaxed me almost instantly. Too instantly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I closed my lips around the edge and pulled more of the tonic into my mouth—until she jerked the flask away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Alright, alright, that's enough. I don't need you drinking too much and becoming all giddy on me." She set the flask back onto the nearby table, with a more stern gleam in her eye. "Now then, would you tell me what you're doing with that enchanted bow?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">There was a weight behind the question. Not anger. Not threat. But something colder—expectation. Like a teacher who already knew the answer, and was just waiting to see how honest I’d be.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The ancient woman gestured to a shadowed corner, and my eyes followed her crooked finger. The dim flicker of a candle revealed my clothing and blue bow, neatly draped over a wall-mounted hook like museum artifacts. Dust motes drifted lazily through the beam of light, catching on the fine hairs of hanging herbs and glittering jars that lined the stone walls. The room was steeped in an overwhelming earthy scent—moss, dried roots, sharp tangs of preserved bark and bitter oil. It felt old, dense with secrets.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Seeing my belongings—laid out, handled, distant—sent a shiver through me. I felt exposed, small. Like something picked clean and set aside for study. My eyes dropped reflexively to myself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Bandages were tightly wrapped across the curves of my breasts, and a scratchy brown blanket clung to my hips and thighs. That was it. My legs, bare and cold beneath the thin wool, curled in instinctively. My cheeks flushed with heat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The old crone caught my mortified glance and cackled like wind through brittle branches.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Oh come now, hehehe, don't look so embarrassed. There isn't anything there I haven't seen before—not that you’ve got much to show, runt. Hardly any muscle at all. Now. About that bow."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Her sudden shift in tone—low and expectant—hit me like a jolt. I swallowed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"It was given to me by the Great Fairy," I said quickly, the words slipping out faster than I meant. I couldn’t stop myself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Is that so... huh." Her eyes narrowed like a snake in tall grass. "I would've hoped that such a wise fairy queen had better judgment. Why would she give a stupid young girl like </span>
      <span class="c16">you</span>
      <span class="c8"> something so powerful?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">My stomach clenched. "Hey! I may have gotten ambushed by that creature out there, but I'm not stupid! The Great Fairy gave me that bow because she said I was the only hope for this world!" I pushed myself upright with trembling effort, only for her hand to slam me back into the bedding again. She was smiling. But there was nothing soft behind it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"The only hope? Ha! If I hadn't been picking mushrooms out there you'd be lizalfos stew meat by now—or strung up with the others, wherever that beast takes them!" she barked, her grin sharp and wolfish. "So you better tell Ol' Kotake the </span>
      <span class="c16">real</span>
      <span class="c8"> story... before I turn you into a Deku toad."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">My breath caught.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Upon hearing her say that name, a jolt of recognition stabbed through me—cold and immediate. The dark-skinned hag’s face blurred with a memory from deep within the Spirit Temple: fire, mirrors, laughter like shattered glass. Kotake and Koume—Ganondorf’s surrogate mothers. My breath caught as I recalled the way their magic had twisted minds, corrupted the Gerudo, and nearly destroyed me. No wonder her voice unsettled me the moment I heard it. She was one of Ganondorf's surrogate mothers! Kotake and Koume! Years ago, I had to fight the powerful witches in the Spirit Temple, back in Hyrule! Their magic had twisted the minds of the Gerudo, built the backbone of Ganondorf’s army, and nearly destroyed me</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Wait! You're one of Ganondorf's minions!" I shouted, recoiling with raw panic. I tried to scoot back toward the wall—toward my bow—but the blanket tangled around my legs and I slipped in the rush. My heart hammered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Kotake’s eyes narrowed as she caught my ankle in her grip, surprisingly firm for someone so ancient. "What? How could you possibly…!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She froze, inspecting me more closely now—my ears, my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Are you from Hyrule? Tch, I should’ve guessed... But no. I'm not one of his sycophants, girl. Koume and I may have been of Ganondorf's tribe, but we fled before his evil spread thanks to a prophetic vision we saw of the Hero of Time bringing about our destruction.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">She stepped closer. "But how do </span>
      <span class="c16">you</span>
      <span class="c8"> even know about us? Our names were erased. Hidden by the Gerudo. You should not know. So—speak. SPIT IT OUT!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I glared up at her, defiant even as pain sang in my bones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Because </span>
      <span class="c16">I</span>
      <span class="c15"> was the one who defeated you. Both of you. And </span>
      <span class="c16">him</span>
      <span class="c8">. I’m the Hero of Time."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I slapped her bony hand away from my ankle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Her jaw dropped, then snapped shut like a steel trap. She barked a laugh—wild, shrill, and humorless.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Scat and swamp fumes! You're a petulant little girl with a head full of stories. Or maybe that potion knocked what few wits you had loose."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"I’m not a girl, you decrepit vine-witch! I was </span>
      <span class="c16">cursed</span>
      <span class="c15"> into this body by the Skull Kid! I </span>
      <span class="c16">infiltrated</span>
      <span class="c15"> your Spirit Temple, freed Nabooru, and killed you both using your own magic! I watched you </span>
      <span class="c16">fuse</span>
      <span class="c15">, and I </span>
      <span class="c16">burned</span>
      <span class="c8"> you down with the mirror shield!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The laughter died. Kotake’s face went still.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">And then, slow as shadow, she drew a small, silvered dagger from beneath her robes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The blade glinted—thin, curved, and wickedly sharp. She moved so close I could smell the acrid tingle of her alchemical robes, feel the stale heat of her breath on my cheek.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She placed the tip to my throat. The edge kissed skin. Then pressed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Who... are... you?" she hissed. Each word etched deeper. "You know </span>
      <span class="c16">far</span>
      <span class="c8"> too much. You're no lost little damsel."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Her eyes burned—not with anger, but with calculation. Fear.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"You have five seconds to explain yourself, before I slit your pretty... little... throat."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I didn’t flinch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I told you. I’m the Hero of Time," I said, voice hoarse but unwavering. "So either end it, or believe me. I don’t care anymore."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The blade trembled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">And for a heartbeat... so did she.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Kotake grunted, muttered something under her breath, and slid the dagger back into the folds of her robe. Her bulbous yellowed eyes remained fixed on me, silent, calculating. Then, like a dam cracking all at once, she threw her head back and burst into laughter—loud, shrill, and deeply amused.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Hahaha! Oh, by the sands, I was starting to think the potion had soured, but it's true! </span>
      <span class="c16">Truly</span>
      <span class="c15"> true! The great Link, Hero of Time, terror of witches and monsters alike, reduced to a scrawny slip of a flower petal! Oh, the irony! The symmetry! The sheer </span>
      <span class="c16">poetry</span>
      <span class="c8">!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She cackled until her breath wheezed. "You and your mirror-shining bravery gave Koume and I nightmares for years, you know. But now? Hah! Look at you. Stripped bare, bandaged, whimpering in my hut like a half-drowned cucco. Heeheehee!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She wiped a tear from one eye, still shaking with mirth. I turned away, flushed with shame and fury, biting the inside of my cheek to keep from screaming.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Oh yes, </span>
      <span class="c16">hardee har har</span>
      <span class="c8">!" I snapped, voice tight. "Why not just kill me already? Take your revenge for your son, or your pride, or whatever’s left of your ego. I’m right here. Go on."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I tried to cross my arms, but pain spiked through my shoulder and I hissed through gritted teeth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Kill you?" Kotake scoffed, waving a gnarled hand. "Child, you're managing that feat just fine on your own. No, I don’t want you dead. Not yet. If anything, I ought to </span>
      <span class="c16">thank</span>
      <span class="c8"> you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Her voice dropped lower.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"You helped open our eyes. Ganondorf—he was going to use us. Just as he used the rest of the tribe. We saw it too late to stop him, but early enough to flee. Koume and I, we’re not </span>
      <span class="c16">evil</span>
      <span class="c15">, girl. We protected our people. We kept them alive when your Hylian kings tried to </span>
      <span class="c16">erase</span>
      <span class="c8"> us."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She stepped away, voice calmer now but no less firm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"History forgets that, doesn’t it? Your royal family tried to wipe out the Gerudo after the Great Wars. Burned our temples. Buried our daughters. But of course, to the hero, we’re just wicked witches in the dark."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She chuckled bitterly, then waved a hand dismissively. "But enough of that. Political ramblings are wasted on ears still soft from fairy songs."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">My jaw clenched. The shame burned hotter now—not just at her laughter, but at the truth I didn’t know how to face. No one ever talked about the other side of the fence… but her words made a kind of uncomfortable sense.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Umm, okay? So if you aren't evil, why did you flee to Termina?" I asked, trying to keep the edge in my voice. "Surely you could’ve stayed and helped the Guard capture Ganondorf. Running only makes you look guilty."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Kotake scoffed, her mouth twisting into something that might’ve once been a smile. "You may be the former Hero of Time, but you’re still a daft, clueless child. Had we stayed, the King's Guard would’ve done to us what they did to the rest of our sisters—imprisoned us, tortured us, and strung us up like warnings."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">My lips parted in protest. "No. That can’t be right. The king wouldn’t allow something like that. He would’ve shown mercy. Unlike your people, who nearly destroyed the kingdom! We restored Hyrule. We—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"—You </span>
      <span class="c16">restored</span>
      <span class="c15"> nothing," Kotake snapped, eyes flaring. "You buried what made it </span>
      <span class="c16">honest</span>
      <span class="c15">. The Royal Family enslaved the races to serve their glory—Gorons in the mines, Zora in the reservoirs, Gerudo in the margins. That’s what started the Great Wars, girl. Your </span>
      <span class="c16">noble line</span>
      <span class="c8"> forced loyalty through blood and blade. If not for your precious ‘goddess’ shielding your people, the Hylians would have crumbled under the weight of their own greed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She leaned close, voice low and sharp. "The only reason your race still exists is because you're the so-called 'Blessed of Hylia.' Keep that in mind the next time you think yourself a savior."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">And with that, she rapped her jeweled knuckle sharply against my forehead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Ow—hey!" I winced, recoiling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Now hush," she muttered, shuffling back toward her table.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I sat in sullen silence, rubbing the sore spot. Her words throbbed louder than the sting on my head. And disturbingly... they didn’t feel entirely wrong. The stories I was raised on never mentioned chains in the mines or drowned songs in the Zora halls.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I turned to apologize—but then my eyes caught on the half-empty flask on the table.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The potion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">A shiver of suspicion curled through me. What if it hadn’t just made me speak the truth? What if it was twisting my thoughts? Making me question the truths I </span>
      <span class="c16">knew</span>
      <span class="c8">?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I stiffened. "Ugh, you can’t brainwash me with that weird potion. I’m not so easily corrupted!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I jabbed a finger at her. "And my people have always been good to the land and its subjects. It’s </span>
      <span class="c16">you</span>
      <span class="c8"> and your ilk who spread poison, who summon monsters, who cause all the trouble—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Kotake slowly turned back, one brow raised. Her grin returned—but it had no warmth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Oh, child. If I had intended to corrupt you, you wouldn’t be </span>
      <span class="c16">arguing</span>
      <span class="c8"> with me right now. You’d be agreeing. You’d be smiling."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Her gaze flicked to the flask.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"That potion didn’t change your mind, dear girl. It just quieted your fear long enough to hear the truth."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I looked away, heat blooming in my cheeks again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Because the worst part was… some stubborn part of me feared she might be right.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I let out a long breath and sank into the mat, the tension in my muscles giving way to exhaustion. Whatever her past, whatever she said about Hylians or the wars, one truth remained: she had saved me. She had saved </span>
      <span class="c16">us</span>
      <span class="c8">. And for that, I owed her at least a sliver of gratitude.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Look... despite all that, you still went out of your way to rescue us. And I guess... whether you're trying to brainwash me or not, I need to thank you. For saving our lives."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">Kotake waved a hand as if brushing off a speck of dust. "Well, it’s what I </span>
      <span class="c16">do</span>
      <span class="c8">. People come from all over Termina to seek my skills and potions. And for the record, I merely gave you a truth tonic. I have no use for a weak twit like you to be a slave anyway."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">My eyes snapped toward her. "Wait—</span>
      <span class="c16">truth</span>
      <span class="c8"> tonic?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Of course," she said breezily, already turning toward her shelves. "You never know what kind of snake slithers in from the swamplands. And </span>
      <span class="c16">you</span>
      <span class="c8">—carrying the Bow of Light of all things—I needed to be sure."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I narrowed my eyes. "So you </span>
      <span class="c16">drugged</span>
      <span class="c8"> me. That’s what you’re saying."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"I </span>
      <span class="c16">protected</span>
      <span class="c8"> myself. You’re lucky that’s all I did."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I huffed and slumped back, flicking my crimson bangs from my eyes with a sharp motion. "Well, now you know who I am. I’m just the great Hero of Time, defeated and cursed into this stupid form by a bratty Skull Kid. Congratulations."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">Kotake hummed, her grin fading into something more thoughtful. "Masked Skull Kid, you say? Ah yes, Koume’s been complaining about strange energies rising in the swamp. But I didn’t imagine </span>
      <span class="c16">that</span>
      <span class="c8"> was the cause. That runt’s been meddling in everyone's business for years, but something this vast..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She trailed off, muttering to herself as she shuffled through a curtain of beaded vines.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">When she returned, she held a glass vial filled with a shimmering red liquid. The light caught it like a flame, casting soft ruby flickers along the walls.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Alright, Missy. Drink this—it’ll mend the damage to your body and restore your strength. I already gave a drop to your fairy friend, so she should be fluttering awake soon."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She caught my hesitation immediately and raised a bushy brow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"No, it’s not poisoned. No, it won’t make you sprout a third eye or worship frogs. Just drink it. I wouldn’t waste good ingredients on a corpse. And besides..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Her eyes glinted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"I have a </span>
      <span class="c16">favor</span>
      <span class="c8"> to ask of you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c18">
      <span class="c8"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She handed me the vial, and I took it reluctantly, the glass warm from her palm. Popping the tiny cork free, I brought it to my nose and recoiled instantly—the scent was like fermented mushrooms and singed wood. Grimacing, I shut my eyes and tilted the red potion back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The liquid hit my tongue like fire-drenched syrup—sickly sweet, then bitter, then sour. I gagged and forced it down, shuddering with each thick gulp until the last drop slid down my throat. I sat there a moment, quivering in disgust.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"There you go," Kotake said, watching with something close to amusement. "Now just lay back down and don't move while I tend to your friend."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I set the empty vial beside me, then slowly reclined against the mat, letting my body sink into the faint warmth spreading through my chest and side. My fingers tingled. The sharp ache in my shoulder began to dull, replaced by a soothing hum that flowed down my arm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Kotake shuffled to a blackened fireplace at the far end of the room. A squat cauldron bubbled over orange flames, filling the space with the thick scent of earth and iron. Tatl lay nearby, still unconscious, curled in a shallow wooden box lined with moss and silk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The witch ladled some of the cauldron’s dark brew into a stone bowl. As she stirred it with a gnarled stick, I watched her closely, uncertain if this was more magic or medicine—or both. A flicker of blue light pulsed faintly along the rim of the bowl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The healing potion surged through me again, and I gasped softly as I felt my muscles knit, the raw pull of my shoulder easing further. Fingers I hadn’t realized were numb slowly curled again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Kotake walked over to Tatl and, with unexpected gentleness, sprinkled a black, shimmering powder over her delicate form. Her voice dipped into a low murmur, words in a language I didn’t understand curling through the air like smoke.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">When she returned, she looked almost… tired.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Alrighty then, your arm should be healed for the most part. Why don’t you stand up and dress yourself. Then we can discuss my payment for saving your life."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Hmph… I guess that’s fair," I muttered, pushing myself upright with a wince. My legs were stiff, my balance unsteady, but the pain had mostly ebbed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I glanced back toward Tatl, her glow now faint but steady.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"What did you just sprinkle onto her?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Kotake grinned, not unkindly. "Still don’t trust me, eh? Hehe, well I suppose that’s wise. I dusted her with something to draw the poison out and nullify its effects. Nothing dangerous. Just a little shadowroot and moon ash. Ancient remedies."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She winked, and I wasn’t sure if it was meant to reassure me—or unsettle me more.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">As I trudged toward my hanging garments, still clutching the scratchy blanket around me, Kotake clucked and snorted, amusement glittering in her bugged-out eyes. She leaned on her stick like it was a throne, watching me with a predator’s patience.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Tsk tsk. You needn't be so modest," she said with theatrical exasperation. "There’s nothing to hide. I had to undress you, you know?" She chuckled, the sound dry as sand scraping stone. "As a former Gerudo matron, I’ve seen more naked women than you’ll ever </span>
      <span class="c16">meet</span>
      <span class="c8">, hehehe. You should be proud of your form if nothing else—most of them would, and have, killed to own such a lovely body!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">I scowled as I reached for my tunic. "This is a cursed body, remember? Why would I enjoy it? The whole reason I’m stuck in this world is to </span>
      <span class="c16">undo</span>
      <span class="c8"> this ridiculous spell."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Oh, I’m sure," Kotake said with maddening cheer, her voice rising in sing-song mockery. A knowing gleam danced in her eyes like firelight flickering over oil.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I hesitated, glancing at my reflection faintly mirrored in a polished copper cauldron. My feminine face—rounder, softer, still unfamiliar—stared back at me with a confused mix of strength and fragility. There were smudges of ash on my cheek, a lock of red hair stuck to my damp temple. I sighed and grumpily pulled the dark brown tunic over my breasts. The neckline was lower than I remembered without the cloak covering it, and still showed off more than I would've liked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Look... my situation’s none of your business. Not to sound ungrateful," I muttered, fumbling with the cloth wrapping around my chest. "But every time I catch a glimpse of myself like </span>
      <span class="c16">this</span>
      <span class="c8">, I’m reminded I can never go back. I’m supposed to be a warrior. Not some damsel in distress."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The words tumbled out before I could stop them—ripped from the tight place in my chest. That truth tonic still clung to my tongue like oil, loosening truths I hadn’t meant to share.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">Then I realized—</span>
      <span class="c16">goddesses</span>
      <span class="c8">, I was still naked below the waist. And Kotake was watching. Her grin widened, toothy and unrepentant.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Heat rushed to my ears. I lunged for my clothing, pulling on new underwear with frenzied urgency, followed by my dark green cloak and fingerless gloves. The bra still lay on the ground like an abandoned challenge. I scowled at it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"And then there's this stupid thing... how the hell do you get used to wearing this stuff??"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Kotake clucked like an annoyed hen and shuffled over to me, picking up the tan bra with exaggerated disdain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Honestly, you are worse than a child..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">With surprising strength, the hag spun me around, stripped off my cloak and tunic in a swift motion, and expertly wrapped the bra around my chest, adjusting the cups so my breasts settled into them properly. Her hands were quick and precise, like someone who had done this a thousand times.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"You're gonna have to get used to it eventually, girly! Heheheh..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I groaned as she stepped back. I bent down to pull on my deerskin boots and grabbed my sturdy gear belt from its peg. The leather was worn smooth in familiar places—finger-hollows, notches, the faint scent of wind and sweat and battle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The weight of it grounded me. I strapped it around my waist and pulled on my boots with trembling fingers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Last, I reached for the blue bow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">Its weight in my hands stilled the storm. I tested the silver drawstring, felt the tension vibrate through my fingertips like a quiet song. It was solid. Real. </span>
      <span class="c17">Mine.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I'll never get used to this. I was the goddess-damned Hero of Time. And now—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Oh posh!" Kotake interrupted. "You sound more like a spoiled little princess than a fallen hero. Your </span>
      <span class="c16">curse</span>
      <span class="c8">—pah! I’ve seen men turned inside-out, children hexed to live as shadows. You’ve got skin, breath, will. Be thankful, you foolish girl."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She thumped me on the head with her stick again—more gently this time, though it still stung.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Now, if you're quite finished bellyaching, I need you to fetch my sister."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Ouch! Would you </span>
      <span class="c16">please</span>
      <span class="c8"> stop hitting me?!" I snapped, batting the stick aside and rubbing the sore spot. My ears burned hotter than ever.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The crone only snickered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"I'm simply trying to instill some sense into that addled brain of yours, you pansy. But are you going to sit there and moan or be on your way to find Koume?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Urrghhh… that was actually the only reason we came this way," I admitted, rubbing the back of my neck. "Frank, the Tour Guide, said she was missing. And we need a boat to go deeper into the swamp."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Eh? </span>
      <span class="c16">Deeper</span>
      <span class="c8">?" The witch croaked in disbelief. "Why on earth would you wish to go further in? You barely survived here on the outskirts!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Ha, I'm not as helpless as you think—watch this..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I reached behind my belt for the familiar weight of my mask.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">My fingers grasped at air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Panic gripped my chest like a vice. I patted my belt, checked my cloak, searched every pouch. Nothing. My breathing quickened as I dropped to the floor, shoving aside furs and satchels in frantic desperation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Watch what? If I wanted to see hysterical floundering, I'd throw a fish onto dry land!" Kotake scoffed. "What in the realms are you looking for now?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"My mask! Where is my mask?!" I cried, voice cracking. "I just had it! No, no, no—this can’t be happening!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Mask? I didn’t see anything like that on you, or anywhere near when I found you," she said, squinting. "Why are you so agitated over a silly trinket?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"It’s not silly! That mask contains the last of my spirit! If I can’t find it, I’ll never turn back—never be myself again!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">My eyes darted wildly around the hut, scanning corners, nooks, under rugs and behind baskets.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Kotake rubbed her chin, expression souring. "Hmm… a very interesting way of preserving spirits. Primitive, but clever. Still, stop flitting your eyes around like a startled cucco. I told you—I don’t have it. You most likely dropped it when Odalwa attacked you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I stumbled onto a nearby stool, holding my head in my gloved hands.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Gods... I'm going to be a girl forever…" I moaned, my voice muffled by my palms.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c15">"Oh, stop your incessant moping! You're worse than a newborn babe! If your precious mask is missing, </span>
      <span class="c16">go find it</span>
      <span class="c8">! It's likely still in the area where the monster ambushed you, you soft-brained twit!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">She stormed over, her stick tapping sharply on the floor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Get up. Find your mask. And find my sister. Your fairy stays here with me as collateral until you return."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I blinked up at her. "But what about Odalwa? I doubt I’d get very far before it found me again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Hmph… I already considered that," Kotake grumbled, fishing in the folds of her robe. She produced a smooth, flat stone no larger than a coin, etched with faded runes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"This is a charm I crafted while you were unconscious. It will keep the monster from sensing your presence. With it, you won't be hunted—unless you’re foolish enough to draw attention again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I took the charm from her wrinkled hand, turning it over in my palm. The grey stone was cool, faintly humming. A tiny, blood-red ruby gleamed at its center, surrounded by flecks of deep purple that shimmered like ink in water. A looped piece of thread was securely wrapped around the charm, effectively creating a necklace.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I exhaled slowly, steadying my nerves. One step at a time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Thanks... I guess."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Kotake gave me a sideways grin. "You're welcome. Now get going before I change my mind and keep your bow too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I pulled the amulet over my head, flipping my hair out of the way, and stood. The charm settled against my chest with a gentle thud, its pulse faint but steady—like a quiet heartbeat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Okay, this is good… umm... do you think you know where Koume might be?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Last I heard, she said she needed to find yantam bark for boat repair. That particular tree only grows in the Shrouded Fens." Kotake waved her hands with exaggerated mystery, her fingers leaving faint trails in the air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Great, but how do I get there?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Phah! So many questions! It’s right down the path behind my hut. There’s a fallen, hollowed-out tree stump that serves as the entrance. Now run along, your fairy friend still needs careful attention. If she wakes before you get back, I’ll let her know you’ve become my errand girl, hehehehe!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I rolled my eyes and turned away, stomping out the door. Her laughter followed me like a swarm of buzzing insects. As much as her teasing grated on my nerves, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Kotake—however irritating—meant well.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">The hut was perched high on a wooden platform built into the thick trunk of an ancient tree. As I stepped outside, the cool air of early dawn greeted me, carrying the scent of dew and distant wildflowers. I stumbled slightly, catching myself before I toppled off the edge. Below, the swamp glistened with a sheen of early light.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">A steep ladder rested against the platform’s rim. I scanned the canopy, ensuring no monsters lurked nearby, then descended cautiously. My boots hit the lower platform with a dull thud.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">Below, a purified spring wound gently around the base of the tree. The water shimmered silver-blue in the light—pure, untarnished, and sweet-smelling. A welcome contrast to the miasma that clung to most of the Southern Swamp.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I circled the trunk, the amulet pressing cool and comforting against my skin. Just as the witch said, a stone path nestled behind the roots, partially concealed by overgrowth. A series of stepping stones crossed the spring. I leapt to the nearest one, water splashing softly beneath me, then bounded across to the other side.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I sauntered onto the path, the misty morning air clinging to my skin. The calls of waking birds echoed through the trees, and the faint gurgle of the spring followed me like a song.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">But without Tatl beside me, the silence felt deeper. Heavier.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Don’t worry, Tatl," I muttered, glancing back toward the tree-bound hut. "I’ll be back soon."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I turned away, squaring my shoulders. Sunlight streamed in golden shafts through the leaves ahead, slicing through the morning fog.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">"Okay, Link, just keep moving and everything will be fine... You’ve been through far worse before. This is nothing."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c9">
      <span class="c8">I nodded to myself, gripped the amulet tightly, and stepped into the waiting trees—where shadow and silence were already beginning to rise.</span>
