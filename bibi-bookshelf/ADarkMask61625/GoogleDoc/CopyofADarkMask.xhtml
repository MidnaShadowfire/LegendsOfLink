    </h1>
    <p class="c20 c29">
      <span class="c28 c9 c16 c8">
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
      <span class="c0">The forest was oddly still and silent. There were no signs of scurrying woodland creatures, nor were there any whispers of a single breeze rustling through the trees. It was as if the land was under some sort of spell, cast into a dreamlike sleep. The very air itself, still as death. The massive trees transformed the bright, noon sunlight into a soft gloom. Looking around, I could see no living thing, aside from the lethargic trees, and I grew doubtful that I would ever find a way out of these woods.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I had been traveling with Epona, my faithful horse, in these seemingly endless woods for the past few days. I truly hoped I would be at the edge soon, and riding into the next kingdom. Or whatever lands lay beyond Hyrule, that is. Not many Hylians had been outside of Hyrule proper, let alone this deep within the Laost Woods...if we even were in the Lost Woods for that matter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Epona continued to trot along at a relaxed gait, not a care in the world. I rubbed a gauntleted hand along her white mane, grateful that she was wit me. Epona shook her light brown head and whinnied happily, her white speckled nose bobbing in delight. I could tell that she was enjoying this easy canter through the serene forest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I chuckled at my companion, giving her another pat on head. Epona had been a close friend since the day we met, and I was very thankful that she joined me on this new adventure. Who knew how long I'd have been stuck in this place without her. Weeks? Months?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I took another lazy glance around to see if anything changed. Nothing new, nothing in the distance but towering trees and placid, almost suffocating forest air. We were seemingly all alone, and there wasn't a single soul in sight. I began to get drowsy with the combination of Epona's gentle strides and boredom, the environment lulling me into deep sleep. I shut my eyes and began to dream of Zelda, and of our last conversation before I left Hyrule...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The castle garden was bright and cheerful, flowers splashed vibrant colors amongst the white castle walls and green grass. Statues dotted the area, immortalizing valiant heroes and noble kings. In the middle of the garden stood a grand effigy of the three Hylian Goddesses Farore, Nayru, and Din. Above their heads rose the Triforce, the magnificent gift the Goddesses gave the world before they departed to the next realm. It was because of the Triforce that I was thrust into my destiny.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I was the Hero of Time, a child bound to the fate of the land. A child destined to fight the greatest evil that had ever befallen Hyrule, the self proclaimed King of Evil, Ganondorf. After a perilous, lengthy, and exhausting adventure, I had won. Following the battle, I met with a fully grown Zelda one last time. We were adults at that time, because I had to travel through time itself to defeat the wicked Gerudo lord, but I still had the mind of a child. Zelda and I stood there on the ruined remains of what was once Ganon's immense fortress. The wind was howling, and dust flew all around us. The princess took my gauntleted hands in her own and knelt down. Tears traced down her beautiful face, streaks of clean lines amidst the caked on dust and sweat. She thanked me and begged for my forgiveness. She blamed her lack of foresight as the reason behind Ganondorf's rise to ultimate power. I shook my head and tried to protest, but she stood up and put a soft finger on my lips to silence me. She said the only thing she could do for me, was to send me back to my own time. Permanently.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The adult princess told me to live my life to the fullest, to experience the full essence of the world...to have a childhood. Zelda took the Ocarina of Time from my belt pouch. As she brought the instrument to her lips, Zelda softly told me to be at peace. As she played the Ocarina, I felt my spirit lift from the ground and I began to soar through time. I arrived back at the Temple of Time, a child once more.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I knew what I had to do. I walked to the Pedestal of Legend one final time, and plunged the Master Sword into the stone with all of my might. Numbed by the realization that this massive adventure was finally, truly over, I trudged through the empty temple, out the imposing entrance, and headed straight to Hyrule Castle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">That was six years ago. Six years of striving for a normal life. But try as I might...I could not. My body was almost fully grown now: I had the musculature of a warrior who had put in countless hours of combat training. I was clad in the attire that Hyrule had come to know: forest green clothing, leather and steel gauntlets, white cotton pants, and tough leather boots. I had never felt that I needed to change my style of clothing. The green Kokiri- spun tunic I wore, albeit modified for an adult's body, was simple, functional, and effective for adventuring through most terrain. The tough material rarely tore and was as sturdy as the trees of the Lost Woods. As I stood there, lost in thought in the garden, brooding over my fate, past deeds, and future life, Zelda, the young princess of Hyrule who was a year or two older than me, interrupted my reverie.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What are you doing, Link?" she probed, "Did you need to see me?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh! Yes!" I jumped, "Sorry, I was daydreaming..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She laughed, "That's fine. It's a common occurrence with you that I've come to adore."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I shifted around, a little embarrassed and unsure of what to say next. I felt my cheeks heat up a little after hearing about her "adorations". After all, she was a princess. And I was...well...a simple 16 year old who preferred adventure, solitude, and battle above all. Still, I could not deny that I was quite attracted to her, despite my self- imposed shortcomings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"So, what is it that you needed to tell me?" she asked with an amused look.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I turned away from her gaze, back toward the Triforce.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I, uhmm, I was going to tell you that I, well..." I paused.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Tell me what?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That I was leaving Hyrule...I can't stay here. There are just too many painful memories..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Silence stretched between us, heavy as iron. I looked back at her, guilt rising in my chest like a tide. Zelda’s gaze drifted downward, where she noticed the full weight of my gear—my polished Hylian shield and the finely forged sword strapped tight across my back. Her breath caught, and when our eyes met again, there was sadness there first, soft and shining. Then came the flicker of something sharper—hurt, maybe even betrayal—before she turned her face away. I thought I saw a tear glint in the corner of her left eye, catching the light like a fallen star. She sighed, voice catching slightly, then cleared her throat and lifted her chin with royal restraint, but her trembling lashes gave her away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You're leaving...but...why? I thought you were happy? I thought..." She tore her eyes away from mine. I definitely saw tears now, as one streamed down her face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I thought we were going to be together? And now you're abandoning Hyrule? Abandoning... me?" Her voice quivered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I took her hand in mine. She hesitated. I could feel her almost try to tear it away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I thought I was going to be happy too... But I can't be. Not after everything I've been through here. All the creatures I've killed and obstacles I've overcome, the friendships created and destroyed. I need..." I sighed, "I need to get away from it, to get far from this place to mend the pain I've been through..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">After what seemed like an hour, Zelda finally spoke in a defeated tone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well...it truly sounds as if your mind is made up. I cannot stop you, no matter how badly I want to. I know how stubborn you can be..." She peered at me through watery eyes, "You must do what you feel you have to...But please. Before you go, take this..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She handed me the Ocarina of Time, the sacred royal family heirloom that allowed the user to manipulate time. The sapphire hue glowed faintly in the sunlight, as she placed it into my hand I felt the weight of the ocarina once again. Zelda took my face into her hands and told me to never forget her. To keep her most treasured artifact with me and to always remember who I was and how much I meant to her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I nodded, and felt a tension in my throat as I spoke,"I will never forget you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Suddenly the world shook. I was rocked from my slumber as Epona reared up at an unseen force. I grasped the reins, but they slipped through my fingers. I was launched off her back, and tossed to the ground. Darkness overcame me. When I came to, I heard voices.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Great job you two! You scored a pretty decent catch this time!" A raspy and childlike voice rang out, "Let's see what he's got on him!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I felt a swift kick as the creature rolled me onto my stomach. Hard, skeletal hands probed my belt pouches. I was still too dazed to get on my feet to confront the entity. All I could do was try to snap out of it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey Skull Kid! What did ya find?" Another voice chimed in, boyish, along with the faint twinkle that fairies are notorious for. "Lemme see! Lemme SEE!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Shut up, Tael! You'll wake him up!" The third voice, more feminine and light, aside from the abrasive tone anyway.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"He's got a sword, so who knows what he's capable of!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Awwww, but Sis I wanna know!" Tael whined.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The other fairy groaned in annoyance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Quiet you guys, look at this thing!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The Skull Kid plucked something from my pouch and began to blow into what sounded like...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My ocarina! I thought, and shook myself awake!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">While the thief giggled in childish delight, I mustered all the strength I could to stand up. I managed to get to my feet through sheer force of will, balancing precariously as my vision still wobbled. The thief playing my ocarina was a skull kid, just like the ones I'd seen from Kokiri Forest. The creature wore a large straw hat and ragged patchy clothing and his thin, fragile- looking limbs poked out from under the tattered rags. Figuring I was still in the Lost Woods, I prepared to draw my sword and attack the prankster. Yet before I could act, the two fairies, one white and the other purple, saw me and twinkled in alarm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The skull child stopped playing, and slowly turned to look at me. The thing jumped in surprise and attempted to hide my ocarina behind his back. On his face, he wore a deep purple, heart -shaped mask with colorful spikes that formed the sides. But what stood out most to me were the eyes. Large, round, incredibly disturbing, orange and green eyes that bulged from the mask. I felt them pierce into my mind, until I remembered that he had taken my priceless instrument. A rush of anger flared up and I thought of Zelda. I lunged at the mischievous runt. The thief suddenly leapt high into the air with unprecedented agility, and landed straight onto Epona's saddle! Epona reared up in fright while the skull kid spurred her to move. Stunned only for a second, I threw myself at the now galloping horse, just barely catching hold of the stirrup.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I clung for dear life, desperately trying to pull myself closer to the insufferable imp! Poor Epona was scared out of her wits—her muscles bunched tight with panic, eyes wide and white-rimmed, every stride a desperate bolt away from the terror on her back. The way she whinnied, sharp and distressed, pierced through my anger and struck something deeper. She trusted me to protect her, and now she was being violated by this masked horror, twisted into a weapon against me. A pang of guilt cut through my fury—I had brought her here, and now she was caught in a nightmare neither of us understood. But even though my anger gave me the strength to hold on, I failed to stop the skull kid. I was being dragged along through sticks, rocks, and thorns that clawed at my skin like angry hands. A jagged stone tore a deep gash along my calf, and every bounce sent sharp shocks of pain up my spine. My tunic snagged and ripped, threads peeling away as the forest carved its punishment into my body. For a fleeting moment, a sliver of fear overtook the anger—a flash of helplessness, of being prey again, dragged through shadow and underbrush by forces I couldn’t yet understand. The two fairies were trying their hardest to keep up, but even they were struggling against Epona’s marvelous speed. The Skull Kid let out shrill peals of laughter, spinning and capering atop the saddle with impossible grace. He danced like a maniacal specter, every motion exaggerated and grotesque, as though the mask fed on chaos. Its surface pulsed faintly with each shriek of laughter, as if drunk on mayhem, growing brighter with every surge of panic and pain around it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Moments later, Epona suddenly leapt over a fallen tree. I couldn't hold on any longer, and my hand went numb. I flew off the saddle, lucky to miss Epona's rear hooves, and I helplessly watched as they galloped away, disappearing into the gloom of the forest...</span>

      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">A Terrible Fate</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">What seemed like an eternity passed as I painfully stumbled along after my stolen horse, heart pounding with a heady mix of desperation and rising panic. Every dragging step felt like a silent cry—one part anger, one part fear—that I might never see Epona or my ocarina again. Thankfully the sleepy forest received minimal foot traffic, and Epona's trail was fairly simple to follow. My legs, though battered and sliced beyond recognition, managed to carry me to a series of massive tree trunks. It was here where the clear trail ended, but I was </span>
      <span class="c4">not</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> going to give up on Epona, or my ocarina. They were beyond priceless to me now. I just </span>
      <span class="c4">had</span>
      <span class="c0"> to get them back!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Thinking I'd get a better view atop one of the tree trunks, I forced myself to clamber up the tallest one. Reaching the top and gasping for breath, with my entire body in agony, I observed my surroundings. Aside from the usual lethargy of the forested atmosphere, I managed to spot a cave where several horse tracks led to. The cave looked as if it was carved into a tree that stood a short distance away, it </span>
      <span class="c4">had</span>
      <span class="c0"> to be their hideout! Thankfully it was much easier to climb down...er...fall down… than it was to struggle up the imposing trunk, but I made it. I crawled my way to the entrance, totally exhausted at this point. I had no idea what I was going to do in this state, I could barely move my arm let alone swing my sword! But, being the stubborn lad I was, I made my way into the cavern despite my injuries. The darkness of the cave enveloped me like a wet shroud, the scent of damp earth and rotting wood clinging to my nose as I stepped into the void. I couldn't make out anything—the blackness pressed in on all sides, thick and suffocating, as if the air itself were holding its breath. I fumbled around the floor, forcing myself to plod forward, when suddenly I was falling!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c4">Greeeaaaaat... </span>
      <span class="c7 c6">I thought. So much effort and pain just to fall to my death. </span>
      <span class="c4 c12">FANTASTIC!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I glanced down, trying to see the very bottom of the pit, but it was swallowed in darkness. A hollow wind howled past my ears as I dropped, accompanied by faint, ghostly echoes that bounced off unseen walls. The rush of air tore at my tunic and made my eyes water, adding a raw chill to the pit's growing dread. This must have been an incredibly deep hole, as I had been falling seemingly for a few seconds. But my thoughts of doom were interrupted by a pinpoint of light below me. As I prepared myself for the crushing blow of the floor below, the tiny dot multiplied into many dots, and then those dots became pictures. I was suddenly falling through faces! Faces upon faces stared me down—some familiar, others twisted into grotesque parodies of memory, their eyes wide and hollow, expressions frozen in masks of sorrow, fury, or vacant indifference. Either due to this new development, or from overwhelming pain, my vision darkened and I drifted into unconsciousness...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I had no notion of how much time had passed, but I was cast out of my comatose state by the feeling of a soft thud against a spongy substance. I opened my eyes slowly and saw that I was no longer falling through empty space. The padded flooring I had landed on was in fact a large, purple flower that had the faint scent of blueberries. All around me, the chamber glowed faintly with a surreal, bioluminescent sheen—the walls pulsing with veins of soft green and lavender light. Strange, twisted plants grew from every angle, some bearing softly humming bulbs, others blooming with hypnotic patterns that shifted like oil on water. The air was warm and slightly sweet, tinged with something earthy and ancient.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I gently pulled myself to my feet, bracing for the sharp sting of torn muscles and scraped skin—but nothing came. My breath caught as confusion swept in. Where I expected agony, there was only eerie ease. For a moment, I just stood there, stunned, warily flexing my fingers and shifting my weight, half-expecting the pain to lunge out belatedly like a hidden trap. To my surprise I felt fine! I looked down at my body to realize I had been completely healed! Not only that, but my green-colored Kokiri tunic and white pants had been fully restored as well. I was still disoriented from the fall, and could barely remember a thing.... Just when I began imagining that I was dead and in the afterlife, bright lights flooded the chamber, temporarily blinding me. I covered my eyes against the sudden brilliance and heard a voice. The same scratchy, childlike voice that I remember stealing...something... from me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Whew, what is with your stupid horse?! It wouldn't listen to a thing I said!" The voice taunted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Suddenly, everything came flooding back to me—Epona! My Ocarina! The memory struck like a lightning bolt, sending a jolt of panic and grief surging through my chest. My breath caught as images of her wide, terrified eyes and the flash of the stolen ocarina tore through my mind. It was all real—and they were gone. The lights dimmed slightly and there, menacingly floating above the ground a few meters away, was the Skull Kid. The two fairies were with him, but where was Epona? I gazed around the grotto in desperation, but my mare was nowhere in sight. All that could be seen, aside from the thieves, was a tiny pond between us, and a few cave sketches carved into the walls. Other than that, it was an empty room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Where is she!" I growled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What? There's no need of a disobedient horse, so I did you a favor and got rid of her!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I blinked in disbelief. Epona? </span>
      <span class="c4">Gone</span>
      <span class="c0">? I clenched my armored fists in rage.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"NOOOO!" I shouted. "You're going to regret ever meeting me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I drew my sword and shield. This creature was going to pay for what he had done! I was at full health now... there was no way I would lose to him this time. He was cornered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oooooo looks like we got a tough guy!" The Skull Kid proclaimed. "What do you fairies think?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The fairies had no chance to respond, I darted forward, aiming to plunge my blade through the Skull Kid's mask. The child howled a malicious laugh, and suddenly my sword transformed into a large tulip and my shield shattered into a powdery cloud. Taken aback, I stumbled and tripped over myself, landing in the shallow water that separated me from the masked skull child.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"HA! You think you can take me as I am now? You think a big, strong man like you can stop me?" Skull Kid said in a threatening tone. "Well...we'll see about that!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I quickly leapt to my feet, searching in the water for something I could use as a weapon. From the corner of my eye, I saw the strange, heart-shaped mask begin to emit a strange purple aura. I attempted to dodge aside, assuming he was about to throw some kind of magic bolt at me, but I couldn't move, my legs were paralyzed! The translucent purple aura had begun to surround me, and I feared that the worst was about to happen and I would be soon joining my ancestors.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The aura slowly closed in around me, encasing my body in its glow. Suddenly ice cold, ethereal tendrils surged from the aura and wrapped tightly around my body. The air thickened, tasting like syrupy rot, and I began to smell a pungently sweet odor as the ghostly tendrils writhed around my form. I felt an intense burning sensation, like something was boiling me from within, reshaping me from the soul outward! Tears of pain welled up inside my eyes as the fiery sensation swarmed over me, overtaking not just my body, but something deeper—my very essence. The ghostly strands pierced into my being, twisting and churning my spirit, dragging something foreign to the surface. I could feel things changing—my balance, my center of gravity, the very way my limbs responded, as if they no longer obeyed quite the same way. The pain became more than physical—it was existential, like I was being unmade. I cried out, the sound lost in the pulse of dark energy surrounding me. Just when I thought I would vanish entirely, the pain stopped. The purple aura withdrew, leaving me gasping on my knees. My lungs clawed at the air. I felt off...wrong...lighter, somehow—but wrong in a way I couldn't yet name.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Heeheeheehee! Take </span>
      <span class="c4">that</span>
      <span class="c0">!" The imp cackled, laced with something deeper than cruelty...something ancient and wrong. "That'll teach you to threaten me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I once again began grasping around the shallow water looking for a stone, a fish, </span>
      <span class="c4">anything </span>
      <span class="c0">to throw at the Skull Kid while he laughed at me. My vision wobbled, but I managed to grasp a decent sized rock and got to my feet, throwing it straight for the heart-shaped mask. The rock smashed into the mask, which cracked faintly at the edge with a pulse of dark light, and the Skull Kid shrieked in pain. The mask seemed to absorb part of the blow, its surface momentarily rippling as if alive, and a low hum of energy thrummed through the air like a warning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeeaarrrghhh! You'll pay for that!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The ground suddenly began to shake, and losing my balance I fell back into the shallow water. I felt weak, off balance, and I could hardly stand! The Skull Kid nervously looked around.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Uughh. You're lucky, I have more important things to deal with right now. I'll finish you off later! You'll be </span>
      <span class="c4">much </span>
      <span class="c0">easier to get rid of by then!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He began retreating toward the sketched-upon wall, and it opened upward like a door. I rose to my feet and began chasing after him, when the white fairy attacked me. Momentarily distracted, I managed to push the offending fairy away and get back to my pursuit, when the door suddenly slammed shut! This shocked the fairy, and it thankfully stopped attacking me as it rushed over to the door.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"H-hey! Skull Kid wait up!" The tiny white fairy shouted. "Don't leave me behind!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">There was no answer and the female fairy twinkled in despair. I felt a twinge of pity for her, but only for a split-second. She was an accomplice to an atrocious act on top of aiding the Skull Kid in robbing me. I ignored her pleas for the Skull Kid to come back, gathering my wits and trying to figure out why I felt so strange. I knelt down next to the pond to splash some water on my face when I saw my reflection. My eyes looked more of an aqua color now instead of the pale blue I remembered, but that was all I could see that was different about me. I shrugged it off, thinking that the water had discolored the appearance of my eyes. I stood back up and looked to the now crying fairy. A flood of emotions churned beneath the surface—was this justice? Pity? Some part of me wanted to hate her for what she'd done, yet another part saw only a lost creature, abandoned and afraid. I wasn't sure what I felt, only that the rage had started to cool—and something else, something quieter, was taking its place.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The pixie turned to face me and exclaimed that she was now separated from her brother, and how it was all my fault. I shot her an irritated glance and walked up to the door. I put my hands on it and began to push up. I had done this a million times before and it was no problem for me. At least, in the past it wasn't difficult. But now I was struggling to even lift it up a couple feet. My arms trembled, my muscles ached... and something felt off in how my limbs moved. My center of gravity seemed...wrong, slightly shifted. That aura the Skull Kid's mask generated must have sapped my strength! But despite this, I managed to get the door just high enough for me to slip through. The fairy, seeing an opportunity to escape the musty chamber, followed suit. Still, I ignored her, and continued down a long wooden corridor. It appeared as if I was walking through a tree...which made sense. I did fall through a hole in a tree, so why not? I was willing to believe anything at this point. The air smelled faintly of bark and decay—ancient, damp, and earthy. As I neared the end of the wooden hallway, the fairy came huffing and puffing after me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Wait! Are... whew... are you just going to leave me behind?" she panted, "You can't leave a poor, defenseless fairy like me to fend for myself!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I looked at her and responded with a spiteful snicker.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Defenseless, eh? What was all that with attacki- </span>
      <span class="c4">squeak</span>
      <span class="c0">"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My voice cracked, sharp and high-pitched like a child’s. The fairy gave me a strange look. I cleared my throat and began again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Attacking me? And why should I help </span>
      <span class="c4">you</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> at all? You've been </span>
      <span class="c4">nothing</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> but trou- </span>
      <span class="c4">crack</span>
      <span class="c0">"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Once again my voice squeaked, painfully so. What was </span>
      <span class="c4">wrong</span>
      <span class="c0"> with me?! There was a strange tightness in my throat now, like something foreign and unyielding had taken root.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The fairy kept giving me that odd look, but after a second she started begging again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Please please </span>
      <span class="c4">please</span>
      <span class="c0"> let me come with you! I promise to tell you all I know about the Skull Kid!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I considered her offer, mulling it over in my head. On one hand, she could be a big help. On the other hand, I wasn't sure if I could trust her. But the pros outweighed the cons, and I nodded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Alright you can come. But if you try anything, you are throu- </span>
      <span class="c4">creak</span>
      <span class="c0">…?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I coughed in frustration. It felt as if there was a tiny, smooth object lodged in my vocal cords. I kept coughing, trying to clear the obstruction. It would not budge. I pressed a gauntleted hand to my throat and leaned my forehead against the cool, wooden wall of the hallway. My whole body trembled—not from pain, but something more unsettling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Are you okay?" the fairy asked gently. "You seem a little distraught?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c4">Distraught? Seriously?</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> I thought bitterly. </span>
      <span class="c4 c12">I had been robbed, dragged through the forest floor, plummeted to my supposed death, and who knew what else was wrong with me... and she says DISTRAUGHT!?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She must have seen the look on my face, because she started apologizing almost immediately.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'm sorry! I-I never meant for this to go so far!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The fairy glanced away, and her demeanor shifted, lowering her voice almost to a whisper... as if she was trying to convince herself as well.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"The Skull Kid didn't use to be so cruel...i-it was all meant to be a simple prank, I swear..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"A simple prank? Killing my horse—</span>
      <span class="c4">squeak</span>
      <span class="c0">—was a simple prank?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The squeaking voice was grating on my nerves. The strange pressure in my throat grew tighter, like an invisible hand slowly wrapping around it. It was most likely due to all the trauma my body and mind had endured... but I wasn’t so sure anymore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You can't tell me it was a prank…" I said in a weary tone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok, ok, look. I will help you out with a whole bunch of things. You sound really tired, understandably…" the pixie reasoned out, attempting to bargain. "I know where a nearby fountain is. You can get help from the Great Fairy there. And if anyone can help you right now with the Skull Kid, it's the Great Fairy!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Fine. Show me where, and you can tag along." I finally gave in. A fairy fountain was </span>
      <span class="c4">exactly</span>
      <span class="c0"> what I needed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Awesome! You won't regret it, I promise! My name's Tatl. What's yours?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Link," I sighed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok great! Nice to meet you... and sorry again…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I refused to respond as we crossed the threshold into the next room.</span>

This room, or abyss I should say, was large and lit by only a few torches lining the walls. Great planks of trees rose up from unfathomable depths, and seemed to support the ceiling of the chamber. From the top of the chamber drooped many large root-like structures, so I assumed we were still beneath the forest. I cast my gaze back downward. From what I could gather from the sparse lighting, I noticed there was very little flooring here—a precarious lattice of wooden planks, some groaning softly beneath my weight as I advanced. I would really have to watch my step.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I began to plod forward with a determination to see the sky again. Tatl kept up with me, lighting the path with her faintly glowing form and we made it to the other side of the area with little difficulty. From this room expanded another hallway. I groaned in annoyance and asked Tatl how much further, being in no mood for games.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Only a bit further! We're almost into town, that's where the fountain is!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And so I started walking into the hall when I suddenly tripped over my loose boot. Wait…loose boot? The thing had fit perfectly an hour ago! My heart skipped—was it shock, confusion, or something deeper? The loose fit felt like a quiet betrayal by my own body, a creeping unease curling through my gut. Did that damned Skull Kid put an age-regression spell on me? That would explain the cracking voice I guess.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Are you alright?" Tatl asked. "You seem to really be having a tough time moving around. You've been tripping all over the place since I first saw you!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No I'm not alright! Your friend put some -creak- kind of spell on me!" I shouted angrily. "What did he do?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She waved her hands in protest, "I had no idea his mask even had that aura ability. How should I know?" The tiny fairy shrugged.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She tried helping me up by tugging at my tunic. I got back to my feet and tightened the buckles on my boots. Hopefully this fairy knew what she was doing. I would hate to have to buy entirely new clothes, and it was doubtful I would find any Kokiri tailors anywhere near here. Yet at the rate I was going, it wouldn't be long before my tunic and white pants slipped right off.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I peered down the hallway, noticing how mechanical the surrounding walls appeared as gears turned slowly. The shift was jarring—a stark, metallic world of ticking gears and oiled steel replacing the organic hush of the forest. It was strangely comforting, but also alien, like stepping into the hollowed-out chest of some vast mechanical beast. The contrast unsettled me more than I expected, and yet, mechanical devices meant civilization. And civilization meant that Tatl was telling the truth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">As we passed through the clockwork hall, the gears began to turn faster. I noticed a heavy-looking metal door up ahead. I brushed the bangs that fell into my eyes away to get a better look. Wait…..bangs? I didn't have bangs? I usually kept my hair trimmed—always short and tidy to stay out of my eyes, especially during battle. Soft strands brushed my forehead, golden and unfamiliar, stirring a flicker of unease in my chest. Had we really been down here long enough for my bangs to grow out? As I was pondering the possibilities of the passage of time, the large door fully opened with a loud, metallic groan. As if it hadn't been opened in ages...but that wasn't right? The Skull Kid had </span>
      <span class="c4">just</span>
      <span class="c0"> come through here!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c4">Maybe time really does get distorted in this place.</span>
      <span class="c0"> I thought.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I asked Tatl about the subject.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, he has a strange ability to move between realms. That's how he does most of his pranking actually." She explained.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, well that's just great. How am I supposed to even find him, then?" I signed dismay.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"The Great Fairy will know, she's very wise, and powerful! She'll know exactly what to do!" Tatl said in a hopeful tone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I glanced back at her, and the pixie smirked. But the smile was short lived and twisted into a faint grimace.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What's wrong?" I inquired, "Can the Great Fairy help me find him or not?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl tried to encourage me by grinning again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh totally! But we had better get there soon."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I grimly shook my head and let out a quiet huff of frustration, the mounting strangeness gnawing at my nerves. Every step, every change, every unanswered question—it was all becoming too much. And Tatl, for all her fluttering help, seemed to offer more riddles than relief. I shuffled through the entryway into a massive chamber of turning gears and pulleys. It looked as if we were in an enormous clock! A small stream ran through the center on the bottom floor where we stood, acting as the engine for the entire device as it turned a huge waterwheel. Sunlight streamed in through small windows on the upper floors, and I hoped that's where the exit would be. I noticed a flight of stairs to our left, so I headed that direction. Nearing the stairs, I noticed my tunic was starting to feel even more loose now, just like the boots.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I tightened my belt again, frowning as my fingers found far more slack than before. The leather resisted at first, then slid too easily—like it had been made for someone else entirely. It sagged lower on my hips than I remembered, the looseness stirring a quiet alarm beneath my skin. It wasn’t dramatic, but it was wrong. Subtle. Creeping. A growing mismatch between body and memory. I crouched to pick up my long, green hat, using the moment to adjust the boot straps again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I peered nervously at Tatl, who was doing her best to look more interested in the waterwheel, avoiding making eye contact with me. I decided to see what her hesitation was all about, noticing that the stream seemed smooth enough to give a somewhat decent reflection. So I walked to the edge nervously, unsure of what I would see, and nudged ever closer. As I leaned down, a lock of blonde hair fell over my eye, feather-light against my cheek. I jolted upright, startled, and let out a sharp, high-pitched squeak—so soft and foreign it made my heart skip.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As the reflection formed in the slow-moving stream, I beheld my face—and a cold, crawling fear crept up my spine. For a heartbeat, I didn’t recognize the person staring back at me. There was something unfamiliar in the shape of my eyes, the softness of my jawline, as if my face were quietly shifting into someone else's. My breath caught, suspended between denial and dread, and I felt the world tilt ever so slightly. My eyes were undeniably a different color now—deeper, more vivid—and as I stared, the subtle softening of my features became impossible to ignore. My face looked younger, finer in structure, and unfamiliar in a way that made something tighten uncomfortably in my chest. The biggest difference, though, was my hair. Blond strands now reached the tip of my nose, drifting in front of my eyes like delicate silk. Without my cap to tame it, the change seemed even more dramatic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c4">And there’s nothing really wrong with me,</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> I told myself, clinging to the thought like a shield. </span>
      <span class="c4 c12">Other than the longer hair, that is. I'm fine. If anything, I’m only under a reverse-aging spell! I can deal with that.... I've conquered gigantic monsters as a child—I’ll defeat the Skull Kid as well!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I smiled optimistically—perhaps too optimistically—and proceeded to tighten my boots, dusting off my cap as I stood. The grin felt a bit strained, more armor than emotion, but I clung to it anyway as I climbed up the stairway, trying to convince myself that everything would be alright. On the second floor, I was relieved to see a large set of wooden doors that gently moved in the outside breeze.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok! Let's go already!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I jumped in surprise, forgetting about Tatl, who was waiting impatiently beside the exit. I still wasn't quite used to having another fairy companion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Alright, alright. I'm -squeak- coming!" I replied, ignoring the cracking of my voice as I headed for the big doors.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I stepped outside, shielding my eyes from the bright midmorning sun, and sighed with relief. </span>
      <span class="c4">Finally!</span>
      <span class="c0"> It felt like an eternity ago when last I saw the sun. I took a deep breath of fresh air and looked around, letting the warm and comforting rays of light soak into my skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stood in the middle of a bustling plaza, where the murmur of voices mingled with the rhythmic clatter of boots on cobblestones. The warm scent of baked bread and dry timber wafted from nearby stalls, grounding me in this strange but vibrant world beyond the forest's shadow. Townsfolk bustled back and forth, weaving around construction workers who were steadily building up a tower of wooden scaffolding. I turned back toward the building we had just exited—and felt my breath hitch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The tower loomed above us, taller than I had imagined. A true clock tower, its brick and mortar body stretched toward the heavens like a monument to time itself....watchful, ancient, uncaring. Its great arms pointed skyward, massive hands marking the hour with solemn grace, as if trying to clutch the sun right out of the sky.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My neck began to ache from staring up at the tower for so long. I finally tore my gaze away and turned back toward the busy construction crew. For a moment, something about them struck me as strangely familiar—like I’d seen their faces before, though I couldn’t place where. But I shook the thought off. I had no time to gawk or daydream.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl was already fluttering ahead, beckoning me with a sharp wave.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Come on! Hurry up! The Great Fairy is just this way!" she called, her voice rising above the din of the bustling plaza.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I followed her into the crowd, weaving between people, trying not to lose sight of her. The mass of moving bodies made me feel small—</span>
      <span class="c4">too</span>
      <span class="c0"> small. I’d faced giant beasts without flinching, but now every elbow, every jostle made me feel oddly fragile. Maybe it was because I’d lost my weapons. Or maybe it was something deeper.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We left the chaotic plaza behind and entered a quieter part of town. The change was immediate—and welcome. The noise faded, replaced by the whisper of leaves and the chirping of birds. We were in a peaceful park, where bright flowers bloomed in clusters and soft green grass shimmered beneath the midday sun. Trees stood like guardians, their shade offering cool relief from the warmth above. I longed to sit down, just for a moment—to rest, to breathe—but Tatl was already zipping toward the hill at the far end of the grove.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The hill rose gently among the trees, and a stone path led to a cave mouth nestled in its side. Smooth steps guided us upward, and I followed, casting one last glance at the calm of the park before slipping into the cool dark of the grotto.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Almost immediately, Tatl gave a cry of alarm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The cave opened into a glowing chamber centered around a fountain—a pool of pale, pulsing light. Fairies hovered above the water in a unified swirl, their wings shimmering with a soft pink hue. But something was off. These weren’t ordinary fairies. They moved in eerie unison, their colors uniform, as if they shared a single will. A hive-mind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>“</span>
      <span class="c0">Great Fairy!” Tatl gasped, flying closer. “What happened to you?!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">In a hundred whispering voices, the swarm spoke as one:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c16">“</span>
      <span class="c12 c30 c6 c16">The Skull Kid has cast a terrible spell upon me. He shattered my essence. He must be stopped… at all costs.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl gestured toward me with a hopeful flutter. “This one—he can help! He’s strong, I’ve seen what he can do!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The pink fairies swarmed me suddenly, circling close. I froze as they examined me with silent intensity.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c16">“</span>
      <span class="c6 c16 c42">Poor dear,”</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> the voices murmured. </span>
      <span class="c12 c6 c16 c30">“You too are touched by his corruption…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I nodded faintly, already feeling the weight of hopelessness pressing down. If the Skull Kid had shattered </span>
      <span class="c4">this</span>
      <span class="c0"> creature of light… what chance did I really have?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c16">“</span>
      <span class="c42 c6 c16">Restore me,”</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> they said in perfect unison. </span>
      <span class="c12 c30 c6 c16">“And I may be able to undo what’s been done. As I am now, I can only ease physical wounds. What afflicts you runs deeper than that.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I opened my mouth to respond, but the world began to tilt. My stomach churned. I stumbled back from the glow and staggered outside, clutching my midsection as nausea overtook me. The moment I hit the grass, the fire returned.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">It wasn’t heat like flame—it was </span>
      <span class="c4">something inside me</span>
      <span class="c0">, twisting and burning and reshaping. My spine arched with the pain as my muscles locked and convulsed. I curled into myself, the world blurring with tears as I bit down on my sleeve to keep from screaming.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My bones ground together. My chest tightened. My head pounded like a Goron drum being beaten by giants. And then—silence. The pain stopped as abruptly as it had begun, leaving behind only tremors and ragged breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I lay there, gasping for air, my vision swimming. Tatl hovered above me, her soft light flickering with worry. She drew close, and I caught the faint intake of breath as she stared at me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A chill ran through me. Something in her expression said everything I needed to know—whatever had just happened… it was worse than I feared.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I didn’t move. Couldn’t move. I simply lay in the grass, limbs limp, staring up at the blue sky I longed to see earlier...trying to make sense of the impossible thing happening to my body, to my </span>
      <span class="c4">self</span>
      <span class="c0">.</span>

      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">A Strange Ally</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c29">
      <span class="c0">"It's ok, don't worry..." Tatl comforted, gently patting my head. Her voice wavered just slightly, like a bell pulled taut by invisible worry. "We can fix this, but you've gotta get up! You're the only one who can help the Great Fairy!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I was still on the ground, lying in the sweet-smelling grass of the park, trying to recover from a painful episode I could only assume was a symptom of the curse. The grass felt soft, almost too soft, like it was trying to cradle me against the weight of my unraveling self. I glanced up at Tatl, who hovered in uncertainty overhead. Despite her attempt at encouragement, her glow seemed dimmer than before.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">But she was right. I had to move. Gritting my teeth, I pushed myself up to my knees. My limbs trembled—not from exertion, but from the unfamiliar lightness that haunted my frame. I may have been weakened, humiliated by pain and mystery, but I wasn’t going to let this curse break me. I would end that wretched imp if it was the last thing I did. I was the Hero of Time, not some sniveling, childish weakling!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I braced myself in case the burning returned, then eased up onto my feet. My balance wobbled. I dusted myself off, wiped my eyes, and swatted the stubborn blonde strands of hair from my face. The motion felt unfamiliar somehow—delicate, instinctive. I bent down to tighten my boots again, their looseness now a persistent and mocking reminder that something was not right.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As I glanced down, something else caught my eye—two small bulges had formed beneath my tunic. I tried shaking it out, thinking it might be dirt or debris from all my falls. But nothing dislodged. Frowning, I reached up and prodded one gently.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Soft. Warm. Sensitive.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My heart leapt into my throat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">These... These were part of me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">A small, involuntary cry escaped my lips, childlike and raw. I slapped a hand over my mouth in horror. That sound hadn’t come from me. Not really. Not the </span>
      <span class="c4">me</span>
      <span class="c0"> I remembered. I tried speaking aloud to reassure myself, but the voice that emerged was higher, thinner—pitched like a young boy, on the edge of cracking. Or someone becoming something else entirely. The sound felt alien in my own throat, like a stranger had taken my place. A quiet dread crept in...what if it never returned to normal? What if this voice was mine now??</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stumbled backward, one hand clutching my throat, the other gripping air. The world felt too big around me, too heavy above me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c4 c12">Why is this happening to me?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">No. Not now. I couldn’t let myself fall apart. Not with the Great Fairy broken, not while the Skull Kid ran free. I had to press on. I had to fix this.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I turned toward Tatl, who was watching me with wide, sorrowful eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You're right. We need to get going," I said in that strange, strained voice, forcing calm into it. "We must restore the Great Fairy. Any ideas?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Uhh… I think we should ask around town if anyone has seen any wandering fairies," Tatl slowly replied, her tone cautious.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok, that’s a good plan. I guess we’ll start in this park area. They couldn’t have gone too far from the fountain."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl nodded and darted ahead, only pausing to glance back at me with something unreadable in her gaze. I exhaled slowly, grounding myself with each step as I followed. One foot in front of the other. Focus on the task, not the shifting terrain of my own body.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The sun had begun to dip lower, straying toward the horizon. Golden light spilled across the grass, making it harder to spot the shimmer of fairy wings. The park was nearly empty now—just a few children in matching blue outfits chasing one another through the trees, their laughter mingling with the sound of popping balloons.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Aside from a vigilant town guard watching over the scene, only one adult remained. A thin, sharply dressed man manned a small stall brimming with colorful masks. His face was hidden—crouched low, fussing with the bottom shelves. His movements were strange: stiff, erratic, like a marionette being jerked by a distracted puppeteer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Despite the oddity, there was nothing overtly threatening about him. And if anyone had been lingering long enough to see a stray fairy, it would be him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I started walking toward the mysterious man. We silently closed in, my steps light and Tatl's wings discreet, neither of us wanting to startle the man. He didn't seem to notice, and still worked his stall, his back to us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey, excuse me, sir, have you happened to see a pink fairy wandering all alone around here?" I nervously asked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He slowly turned toward me. An oddly familiar man with short orange hair, his face gaunt and off-putting, grinned back at me—but something was wrong. His eyes sparkled with an unnatural glee, a little too wide, a little too knowing. The smile didn’t quite reach them, and the way he moved, fluid yet abrupt, sent a quiet chill skittering down my spine.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You have met with a terrible fate."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Wha...what did you say?" I whispered, genuinely disturbed. Tatl darted behind me to hide herself from the man's sight.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"A terrible, terrible fate." He continued. "A curse that forces you to change into something you are not. A curse brought on by a very dark and evil mask...yes?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The man laughed, strangely enunciating his words as if he didn't quite know how to speak proper Hylian.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I...umm...yeah that's right! How di—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Why, it was my mask that did these terrible things!" He interrupted, his face growing dark with anger. "It was stolen from me by a very impetuous creature. A Skullchild nonetheless, yes... And through my foolish inattentiveness, I have caused great suffering here...great suffering indeed!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I flinched as he gesticulated his long, thin arms around with wild and sudden movements.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You! I shall assist you...but only if you assist me in helping to restore this world. For it is in grave danger, oh yes it is!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He raised his hands toward the sky, and a strange hush seemed to fall over the air between us. My gaze followed, hesitant, and I gasped. The sheer size of it—the monstrous moon—filled the sky with a suffocating presence. But it wasn’t just its unnatural closeness that struck me cold. It was the face. Furious, leering, twisted in a scowl of such raw hatred it made my stomach lurch. I felt as though it saw me specifically, as if that furious expression was aimed at my very soul.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">That sharp chill creeping down my spine now shuddered through my whole body.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Soon this world will be no more. Gone! And others are sure to follow. We must get my mask back, you see?!" The man begged in desperation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Suddenly I remembered where I had seen this man before. He had once sold masks in the Hyrule Castle Marketplace—a harmless, eccentric merchant with a strange way of speaking and a knack for unsettling smiles. But now, standing here under that baleful moon, he seemed like a twisted echo of that memory. And not just him—so many of the people I'd seen in this town bore uncanny resemblances to those I’d known back in Hyrule. Familiar yet wrong, like reflections in warped glass. Was this all a dream? No... it felt more like I’d stepped into a nightmare shaped by memory—something that knew me better than I knew it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok, we will help you get your mask back! But you have to help us first!" Tatl chimed in. "We need to cure the Great Fairy!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"The Great Fairy?" queried the Salesman. "What's wrong with the Great Fairy?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"She's been shattered into pieces!" Tatl exclaimed. "If we don't help her soon, she could die!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The mask salesman silently pondered, and his hand darted to his chin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"So you need to find the missing pieces...hmmmm?" He smirked. "I believe I can lead you in the right direction. I have heard that there has been a mysterious light spotted around the southern end of town, yes!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Where did you hear that?" I asked, suspicious.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The mask salesman grinned at me. "Why...it is information that often supplies happiness! And happiness is what I distribute! Therefore information is like happiness in itself, indeed!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Uhhh...right. That's good enough for now, thank you, sir!" Tatl thanked, flying off along the dirt path. "Come on, Link! I know the way! Follow me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stepped away from the creepy man, and dashed off after the fairy, trying not to trip over my ill-fitting leather boots.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The sun had just set when we neared the middle of town. The hustle and bustle of the city began to die down as people went back to their homes for the night. Bells rang out—some high and melodic, others low and sonorous—announcing the closing of shops with a mournful sort of finality, like the town itself was exhaling after a long day. I was happy to finally get some space; the streets had been tremendously busy. Through eavesdropping along the way, I learned there was an annual festival everyone was preparing for. Oddly enough, it seemed as if no one else had noticed that the moon appeared as if it were screaming in rage, and was looming as if to crush them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I glanced around at the various shops we passed by, viewing the multitude of items being peddled behind windows. In a very rare instance of materialistic desire, I was envious of those who could afford the items from these expensive shops. I almost wished I could relax, buy some food, and new boots that fit. My (now too large) boots were killing my feet, and a pressure building within my chest was making it difficult to breathe. I was starving and parched with thirst—the aromas wafting from nearby diners sent pangs through my stomach, each scent a cruel reminder of how drained I truly was. My body felt like it was running on fumes, every step heavier than the last. Maybe that explained the gnawing panic in my chest. Maybe it wasn’t just the curse. Maybe the exhaustion, hunger, and creeping disorientation were warping my sense of reality.? Maybe this really was all a dream?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I shook myself out of my fantasizing. This was real. Everything was far too vivid and tangible for this not to be reality.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I focused on Tatl and willed my feet to follow as she led the way through the</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">winding roads. Eventually Tatl spoke, and I could only assume we made it to our destination.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Be careful here, Link. Southside is kinda dangerous at night. A lot of thieves and their ilk roam around and do business in this part of town due to the lack of shops and wealthy homes. The guards rarely enter, aside from gate duty."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I flit my gaze around. The buildings were in shambles, their wooden frames warped and groaning in the wind. The air carried the acrid tang of soot and spoiled vegetables, mixing with the musty scent of damp wood and grime, and the roads poorly looked after. There were only a few people around. A shirtless, gaunt beggar miserably sat on an old crate, staring at the dirt, and low class citizens wearing patchwork clothing and worn shoes shuffled back to their hovels. I was thankfully ignored by the retiring denizens. I knew I couldn't handle being robbed right now. Several stars had finally begun to shimmer against the clear, indigo skies of twilight, peaceful and radiant...the exact opposite of how I felt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Link! Look!" Tatl suddenly pointed in excitement, bobbing up and down.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My eyes followed her gesture and locked onto a flicker of orange light just ahead—an ethereal flutter rather than the steady burn of a torch. My breath hitched. For a heartbeat, time felt suspended, and a thrill of hope surged through me. Was it truly one of the Great Fairy's fragments? Or was my mind playing tricks in the deepening dark? Tatl and I ran after it with renewed vigor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As we drew near, I examined the area closely. Just below the rooftop of the decrepit wooden building was a tiny light. It fluttered: definitely not a torch...Yes! Yes, it looked just like the pink fairies in the Fountain! Tatl flew up to greet it, and I saw small flashes of color and heard a faint series of twinkling. Finally, the lost fairy happily flew down.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh thank you! We were so lost until you found us! Please take us home?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok, let's hurry up and get you back!" Tatl declared. "Then Link and I can go find my brother, and Skull Kid!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I followed sluggishly after the retreating fairies, hoping that I would get a chance to rest my aching feet when we got back. My body was put through so much today, from the violent dragging through the forest to the debilitating effects of the curse. I still hadn't been able to rest, and I felt the numbing exhaustion seep through my muscles.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">It was after midnight by the time we returned to the north end of town. The trek was easy without having to constantly shove through the crowds. I was grateful the park was devoid of people, but the mask salesman had also disappeared.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">During the walk through the darkened park, I was stopped by a chubby guard who sleepily asked what I was up to, and where I was going.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That's none of your business you nosy tin can!" Tatl verbally assaulted the guard, slamming his visor shut. "Go bark up a different tree! Or better yet, go jump off the clock tower!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The guard, pink fairy, and I were all equally taken aback at Tatl's unexpected outburst. The guard immediately retreated, visibly shaken, and smacked directly into a tree branch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ooomph!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The loud clanging of steel crashing to the ground muffled my quiet laughter. A reluctant grin tugged at my lips—maybe I was beginning to like this spunky fairy, despite everything. But I forced the thought away. Admiration had no place right now, not when every step forward still carried the weight of the unknown. There was no time for admiration. We still had a job to do, and we made our way to the entrance of the fountain, now lit by the welcoming glow of large torches.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We entered the cave, and the lost fairy excitedly twinkled and rushed into the mass of floating pixies. The multitude of glimmering fairies suddenly shone with a brilliant light that pulsed with rising intensity, casting wild, dancing shadows along the cave walls. The air vibrated with a humming resonance, like the chime of a hundred tiny bells, as each mote of light spiraled into the air. I squinted, shielding my eyes against the radiance as it coalesced into a single, dazzling shape...</span>

      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">The Great Fairy</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c20 c37">
      <span class="c28 c9 c16 c8">
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
      <span class="c0">The intense light radiating from the figure began to dim, and I saw a large, imposing fairy gracefully emerge. Her presence was ethereal—otherworldly. The Great Fairy's hair cascaded like silken flame, pink and impossibly weightless, drifting as if underwater. She was clothed head to toe in garments woven from living flora: smooth green vines twined around her glittering arms and legs, while blossoms of every color shimmered across her body like living jewels. Atop her head sat a crown of roses, deep and dark as burgundy wine, twisted together like sacred twine. All around her, minuscule fairies danced in celebration, their twinkling wings forming halos of light around the return of their queen. I had seen Great Fairies before—but none with this elegance, this strange and solemn beauty.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You have done it, young Hero, and you have my eternal thanks. Please, allow me to heal your wounds…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She extended her hands toward me. I closed my eyes and felt a warm, golden sensation envelop me, flowing over my skin and deep into my spirit. The aches and fears that had clung to me like chains began to fall away. My hunger, my exhaustion, the tension in my limbs—gone. It felt like sinking into a childhood dream, some half-remembered place where I had once felt truly safe. I stood beneath her magic as if in the sun after days of rain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A few moments later, the energy gently withdrew. I opened my eyes and met her gaze.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Young Hero of Ages," she said softly, "as I tended to your wounds, I glimpsed far deeper—into the weave of your soul. There, I sensed greatness, and an immense power shining within. But I also felt a shadow: a very strong and dark magic entwining with your essence, warping it." A look of sorrow crossed her radiant face. "I’m afraid I cannot undo what the Skull Kid has done. His newfound power... it is greater than mine."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I turned slowly to Tatl, dismay tightening in my chest. Her glow was flickering red with alarm, and her expression crumpled with helpless terror. I didn’t need her to speak—I could see it in her trembling light. If even this majestic being could not stop what was happening to me, then what hope did we have?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The Great Fairy’s own brow furrowed. Around her, the small fairies flitted faster, chittering in unrest, winding through the plumes of her hair like scattered sparks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"So... what, I’m helpless here?" I snapped, the words tumbling out harsher than I meant. "I can’t do anything but wait for this curse to finish with... well, </span>
      <span class="c4">whatever</span>
      <span class="c0"> it’s doing to me?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"You are not helpless, young one," she replied, her voice a chord of calm conviction. "In truth, you are still the </span>
      <span class="c4">most</span>
      <span class="c0"> capable soul in this realm to face the darkness. The path forward will be yours to carve—but carve it you must, for if the Skull Child is not stopped, all life here will fall into shadow."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I lowered my gaze to my feet, but my eyes betrayed me—drawn instead to the delicate weight resting on my chest, and the strands of golden hair brushing softly against my collarbone. I closed my eyes, trying to quiet the chaos in my heart. It would not be her who saved me. If there was any hope of breaking this spell, of understanding what was being done to me, I would have to find it myself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Alright….I guess I have no choice. But if I must do this, I'm going to need help." I said as I looked at Tatl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The white fairy made eye contact and jerked back in surprise, her wings faltering mid-hover as if she, too, hadn’t expected me to reach out. For a moment, hope and hesitation warred inside me—was I really asking her for help, or was I just too desperate to stand alone any longer?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"M-me?" She asked in astonishment. "Why would you want </span>
      <span class="c4">my</span>
      <span class="c0"> help? I'm one of the reasons that you're even in this predicament! That curse must be driving you crazy…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stepped closer to her. "I could be going crazy, or maybe this curse is in fact weakening my judgment, but either way...I desperately need help. And I think that you would be my best case support here...You know this place far better than I do."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl just hovered in silence for a moment or two. Then she began quivering, sending tiny trails of glimmering fairy dust tumbling from her wings. A tiny grunt sounded and she nodded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Fine...but </span>
      <span class="c4">only</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> because my brother could be in grave danger….and I might feel a </span>
      <span class="c4">little</span>
      <span class="c0"> guilty about what's happening to you." Tatl's voice rang. "And don't think that we're going to be friends or anything, I just owe you! But ….thanks I guess. Thanks for giving me a chance." She muttered, then smiled at me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I returned her smile and turned back to the Great Fairy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"So..." I spoke in my strangely higher pitched voice, "I guess we are all set to go now, although I have no clue on where to start. I really hope you have some kind of idea of how I should proceed?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The Great Fairy pondered for a second, then snapped her fingers. A troop of her fairy escorts flew up to her face and the Great Fairy nodded to them. The fairies chimed in unison and flew into the back of the cave. The large, opulent Fairy returned her attention to Tatl and I.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I believe the first place you should investigate is the Star Chamber, just outside of town. There you will meet with an old astronomer named Reton. The moon has been looking very strange and... terrifying, recently. I'm sure that it's a clue to the Skull Kid's whereabouts."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That old kook?" Tatl twinkled, "He's as crazy as a bombchu on magic dust! How could he possibly help?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The Great Fairy shot Tatl a look of disapproval and continued.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"First try leaving the town through one of the city's various gates. The Star Chamber is just to the south of Clock Town. If that doesn't work, there's a small group of local boys, outcasts and orphans mostly, that have come to call this Star Chamber their secret hideout. They should know of a special way into the Chamber, but I've been told that only members of their little club are allowed to use it. So I'm afraid that you are going to have to somehow earn their respect...and it likely will not be easy due to how the skull kid's curse is affecting your appearance."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Wait, what? Affecting my appearance?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My breath caught, and I instinctively touched my face, then glanced down at my hands—smaller, thinner than I remembered. A chill crept up my spine. Was I really changing that much? I hadn’t checked my reflection since leaving the tower. The thought that my appearance might already be unrecognizable sent a flicker of panic through my chest.  What did I look like now? I didn't have a chance to ask as the small fairy squad returned, carrying a glistening item.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The Great Fairy took the item and thanked them. She then reached out with her arms once again, and the object drifted gently into my open hands. It was a bow—unlike any I had ever seen. I turned it over reverently. The wood shimmered with a deep sapphire luster, almost as if the night sky itself had been woven into its grain. Etched along its limbs were delicate carvings of roses in various stages of bloom, their thorny stems entwined like a protective bramble. Subtle streaks of iridescent green shimmered beneath the surface, shifting in the light like dragonfly wings. Its grip was wrapped in a soft, supple leather the color of dew-touched ivy, textured like a living vine. The bowstring, impossibly fine, glowed faintly with silvery filaments—like moonlight captured in silk thread. It felt impossibly light, balanced, and somehow... alive in my hands, like it had been waiting for me all along. I looked back up to the Great Fairy, awestruck.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"This bow is amazing !" I said incredulously. "I've never seen such fine craftsmanship!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That bow was given to me as a gift long ago, by an old and dying hag from another land." The Fairy responded. "I had helped to heal her soul from an evil that tormented her. She said it would prove to be invaluable when the world was in a diresome state. How correct in her prediction she was…. But I digress. I have a feeling you will be needing it, and that it will serve a more fulfilling purpose with you rather than sitting here, languishing away in this fountain."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I was almost speechless at the priceless gift, and I bowed deeply.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I will definitely treasure this, and make sure that it is used to its full potential..." I vowed reverently.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I flourished in farewell, and prepared to leave with Tatl. The Great Fairy wished us luck, and prayed that I succeeded in my quest as we exited the fountain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We departed from the cave entrance, and I noticed that dawn was quickly approaching. The sun, just barely peeking over the edge of the horizon, was blood red, signalling a stormy day. I looked toward the area where the mask salesman would be, half-expecting to see his crooked smile and erratic gestures still occupying the stall. A flicker of unease passed through me when I saw the space empty—just flattened grass where his stand had once been. Had he moved? Disappeared?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c4">Odd…</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> I thought. </span>
      <span class="c4">He may have moved to a more profitable part of town</span>
      <span class="c0">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I searched around the park for any signs of the salesman or troop of boys the Great Fairy mentioned, but it must have been too early as the park was silent and empty. I asked Tatl to go search one side of the area, while I looked around the other. A faint breeze was beginning to whisper through the trees, bringing a damp chill upon its breath. I walked around the area, looking for any sign of those kids or the mask salesman, but turned up with nothing. Ready to move the search on to another part of town, I called out to inform Tatl and started to walk towards the park exit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"There's no one here! We need to move on to another area and find that mask salesman! Then we'll give him an upda—AAAARRGHH!" I screamed, my body seizing in sudden agony. An unbearable fire lanced through my spine like wildfire, sharp and twisting, as if my very bones were rebelling against me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The awful burning sensation was back—stronger, sharper, more agonizing than ever! I doubled over and fell to the ground, clenching my stomach as a cry tore from my throat. Tatl must have heard, because she was at my side in seconds, darting frantically through the air like a panicked hummingbird.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My body began to jerk in violent spasms, twisting uncontrollably. That same aura from before, the one that had wrapped itself around my soul, writhed within my skin like a molten serpent. It felt like something inside me was dissolving—changing—becoming something it was never meant to be. My limbs buckled as if they were being crushed in a vice, and my face felt like it was being gnawed on by ravenous Wolfos. I could barely breathe. Streams of salty tears spilled from my clenched eyes, and black spots blossomed behind my lids as consciousness began to fade.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hold on!" I choked through gritted teeth. "Hold on!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">At last, the boiling agony began to ebb, the tearing faded, and my writhing stilled. I lay limp on the dew-soaked grass, every breath labored. I blinked open my eyes and tried to rise, but my muscles refused. I tried again, dragging my arms beneath me. Tatl tugged at my tunic's collar with surprising strength, helping me shift from sprawled on my belly to resting on my knees.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I pushed up shakily—and face planted directly into the grass. Thankfully, it was softer than stone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ummm... maybe you should take it easy for a second," Tatl suggested, gently tapping my forehead. She pointed toward a tall oak tree behind me. "There's a tree right there you can lean against."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I groaned, a cough bubbling up from deep in my throat. Something dislodged—like a blockage coming loose—and I hacked repeatedly. I raised a hand to rub my neck and felt the gauntlet slide clean off. My breath caught.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My hand was... wrong. The fingers were slender, longer, more delicate. My nails were smooth, clean—nothing like the calloused, dirt-caked warrior’s hands I knew. I flexed them. They obeyed, but it felt foreign. Disconnected.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">What was happening to me?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Now now..." Tatl’s voice was soft. "It’s going to be okay. Stay calm… Let’s just get you to that tree."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I stared at her, speechless, then gave a reluctant nod. I began to crawl toward the oak, my limbs still shaking. Silken strands of strawberry-blonde hair kept falling into my eyes—long enough now to sweep past my shoulders. I angrily blew them away. </span>
      <span class="c4">Just get to the tree,</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> I told myself. </span>
      <span class="c4 c12">Don’t look. Don’t think. Just move.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl hovered at my side, pulling gently at my sleeve as I dragged myself the last few feet. I slumped against the rough bark, muscles trembling with exhaustion. I felt like I’d run a thousand miles through fire. Tatl was panting, wings fluttering erratically, but she managed to pat my head with a breathless, encouraging touch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"There! -pant, pant</span>
      <span class="c4">-</span>
      <span class="c0"> We made it," she wheezed. "Just relax... for a second."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Supported by the tree, I finally dared to look at myself. I raised my right hand, turning it over, studying it. Reddish-blonde hair drifted into view again, and I caught a lock between my fingers. It was silky, smooth... too soft. Too real.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I yanked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A high-pitched yelp burst from me. "Owww!" I gasped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl winced. "Yeah, you shouldn't do that. Pulling on long hair tends to hurt."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I shot her a scowl, but her expression softened with apology.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Okay, okay… I’m sorry. That came out a little harsh," she muttered. "I just don’t know how to react. I’ve never seen this before." She hesitated, then added, "Buuut... as much as I’m sure you don’t want to hear this… I think you may need some new clothing."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I looked down. My Kokiri tunic now hung from my body like a bathrobe several sizes too large. And... the lumps I’d felt the day before had grown. Round. Full. Soft. Real.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I turned away, flushed with embarrassment, hiding my face behind my hair.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Umm… look. It’s...uh... starting to get brighter," Tatl said hesitantly. "Soon people will be out and about. We really should find you something to wear. I think Clock Town has strict laws about human nudity in public… and... you’re just barely skirting those laws. Uhh… no offense."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I glared at her, too mortified to speak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Okay, how about this: I’ll go try to find something for you to wear while you return to the Great Fairy’s fountain and wait. That way you won’t attract any unwanted attention, and I can figure out our next move. What do you say?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I rolled my eyes and used the tree for balance, Tatl once again tugging at my hand to help. I managed to rise, legs wobbly as pudding. My first step slipped—my foot slid right out of my boot—and I would have hit the ground again if not for Tatl and the tree catching me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My white cloth pants nearly slipped down with it. I yanked them up with a furious tug and growled under my breath. Enough. I kicked off the remaining boot in frustration.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I really liked those boots. Sturdy, reliable, practically indestructible. Perfect for swordplay and travel. But... I couldn’t wear them anymore. Not like this.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl fluttered down to gather the boots and fallen gauntlets. I took a steadying breath and tested my balance again. My legs felt slightly stronger—enough to walk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And so, with nothing fitting, everything changing, and the sun rising behind us, we made our unsteady way back to the fountain…</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I didn't know what awaited me there...but for now the next step was all I could take.</span>

    <h1 class="c13" id="h.mvddb2a19n1q">
      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">Twisted Misfortune</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I shambled into the Great Fairy's shelter with Tatl cautiously following behind, ready to lend a hand if I started to fall again. Dark, foreboding clouds had blotted out the rising sun, and the wind shifted, bringing the scent of rain with it. As the first droplets fell, a chill crept beneath my tunic, making me shiver—it wasn’t just the cold, but something deeper, like the world itself was holding its breath. Thankfully, we arrived at the cave opening just before the drizzle turned heavier. Tatl helped me along to a corner where I pressed my back to the wall and slid down the smooth stone to sit. Tatl dropped the boots and gauntlets she’d been carrying beside me, and quickly dashed outside once more. I weakly turned my head to glance at the fountain. The Great Fairy had disappeared and only a few small, pink fairies fluttered around the spring waters. A damp Tatl returned moments later, dragging the Great Fairy's luxurious gift behind her and releasing it a few feet away from me. The luminescent blue bow lightly thudded against the hard cave floor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Ok </span>
      <span class="c4">huff</span>
      <span class="c7 c6">, I'm pretty sure the Great Fairy has gone to get some much needed rest...lucky..." Tatl twittered, out of breath from hefting my things around. "Just stay here </span>
      <span class="c4">pant</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> for the time being, and I'll be back with some clothes that will hopefully fit you </span>
      <span class="c4">whew</span>
      <span class="c0"> better."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She took a deep breath then circled around me, likely trying to figure out what size I needed. I just stared at my feet, trying to distract my panicking mind from having a meltdown. My emotions churned like a storm tide—anger crashing into despair, giving way to grim determination, only to drown again in suffocating hopelessness. My chest ached with each breath, and a faint tremor had taken hold of my limbs, as if my body could barely contain the turmoil within.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Link, look at me!" Tatl shouted, breaking through my despairing thoughts. "It's going to be alright! We'll find the Skull Kid, you'll defeat him and reverse the spell on you, and then everything will be back to normal!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The fairy's words filled me with a tiny bit of encouragement, but not like before. I hesitantly looked at her twinkling form. She looked just as scattered and uncertain as I felt, so I tried my best to crack a smile and answered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok…." was all I could mutter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I sat there in stunned silence, my fears having been validated. The voice that escaped my lips was unmistakably feminine—light, fragile, and entirely foreign. I balled my fist and, rather unwisely, pounded the hard rock wall. Spurts of pain shot through my thin wrist and I clasped it with my other hand, gently massaging it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Tatl cast a worried glance my way before turning to the exit, then fluttered off on her hunt. I didn't know how long I'd be waiting here, but I hoped that she wouldn't be gone for too long. Curse or not, I still had to stop the Skull Kid. What he had done...what he continued to do, was deplorable. I remembered Epona's fate and quietly mourned her loss. I hadn’t allowed myself to fully feel it until now—there had been too much chaos, too much pain. But in this quiet moment, the grief settled like a stone in my chest. I thought back to when I first saw her—a tiny filly, nervous and unsure, only trusting of Malon, the ranch owner's fiery daughter. I had rescued her from Ingo’s cruelty, and from that day on, we had been inseparable. She was more than a companion—she was a piece of home, a piece of </span>
      <span class="c4">me</span>
      <span class="c0">, from a time before the world began to unravel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Now, with my very identity unraveling, her absence cut deeper. She represented a tether to the life I once knew, and now that tether had snapped. A single tear traced down my cheek, carrying with it the weight of everything I was losing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Thunder rumbled outside the cave, shaking me out of my memories. The low growl of the storm felt like an echo of my own turmoil, reverberating through my ribs like distant thunder made flesh. The smell of fresh rain drifted in on a chilled breeze, brushing past my skin like ghostly fingers. I hugged my arms tightly around my uncomfortably protruding chest and curled my legs in close, trying to trap what little warmth lingered in my bones. My loose clothing clung to me, still damp from the dew-soaked grass, and my bare feet and hands tingled with cold. I reached up, half-hopeful, to take my cap and warm my hands inside it—only to find it gone. Who knew where I’d lost it? I didn’t really care anymore. All that mattered was that Tatl returned soon with something warm, something that fit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The fairy fountain shimmered quietly before me, its waters rippling with rain droplets that echoed through the cave in a rhythmic lullaby. The pink fairies were gone, leaving behind only the whispers of the breeze and the soft gurgle of the spring. Time seemed to stretch endlessly. It felt like hours had passed since Tatl had left. My patience was wearing thin, and the chill was starting to bite deeper. I couldn’t just sit still any longer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I rose unsteadily and walked toward the fountain, each step slow but more confident than before. My strength had partially returned during the wait, though my body still felt foreign. The stone floor was slick and cold under my bare feet, sending shivers up my legs. I wrapped the damp tunic tighter around my body, seeking warmth where there was none.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">When I reached the fountain, I leaned over it slowly, apprehension knotting in my stomach. The surface revealed a stranger—dark green eyes wide with disbelief, pale fingers rising in sync with mine to touch a face I barely recognized. My once angular features had dissolved into gentle, unfamiliar curves. A dainty nose. Fuller lips. A rounded jaw. My hair was no longer the short blonde mop I remembered—it was now a thick, reddish-blonde curtain falling just past my shoulders. Even my ears had changed, now longer and sleeker, angled like delicate blades.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">This wasn’t a disguise? This was...me?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stumbled backward from the reflection, breath caught in my throat. Anger flared up through the fear, hot and righteous. I was not going to let this stop me. The Skull Kid wanted me weak—wanted me confused, lost in my own skin. But I was the Hero of Time. I had slain beasts twice my size and faced gods in shadow. I had stared down destiny before and carved my own path. I would return to Hyrule. I would marry Zelda, raise warriors, and pass down the strength that had brought me this far.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">But then a terrible thought surfaced. I reached between my legs in a panicked reflex.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Relief washed over me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Everything was still there. I silently thanked the gods and, bolstered by the reassurance, returned to my corner with a steadier step.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl arrived just as I settled down, dripping wet and panting with effort.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Ok! </span>
      <span class="c4">pant</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> I think I found something </span>
      <span class="c4">whew</span>
      <span class="c0"> that might fit you!" she gasped, her glow flickering with exertion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She dropped the knapsack and collapsed beside it, wings twitching.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I rushed over, concerned, but she waved me off.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Don't worry about me! </span>
      <span class="c4">huff huff</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> Just hurry and put those on before your tunic falls off and you blind me with your disgusting human body!" she barked. "Trust me, I won't look! </span>
      <span class="c4">huff</span>
      <span class="c0"> Just put the dumb clothes on already!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Rolling my eyes, I knelt beside the bundle and opened it. To my surprise, Tatl had managed to piece together a decent outfit—and miraculously, everything was dry. There was a dark brown cotton tunic, long and loose around the neck, a pair of snug black pants, small brown fingerless gloves, a dark green cloak, and supple deerskin boots.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">After checking that Tatl was still catching her breath and not peeking, I undressed quickly, avoiding my reflection in the stone. The tunic slipped over my head easily, soft and oddly comfortable. It hung to mid-thigh and clung to my new, slimmer frame. The leggings were more of a struggle—tight, itchy, and pulling unkindly at leg hair I still had—but they were warm. I adjusted them with a wince.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You can look now, Tatl," I said, my voice painfully light.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl took to the air again, circling me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Huh... not bad. I'd say I did a good job." She smirked. "Okay, now put the rest on and let's get going."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I slipped into the boots, their tops reaching just below my knees. They were snug but solid. The cloak, though damp on the outside, was lined with soft fur that instantly warmed me. I wrapped it around myself and re-fastened my old belt and pouches.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"How do I look?" I asked while sliding on the gloves.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl tilted her head and shrugged. "It'll do. But hold still, you're a mess."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She zipped around my head, tugging and twisting until my hair was pulled into a tight ponytail, leaving a curtain of bangs to frame my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Okay, done. Go check it out. But, uh... brace yourself. You've changed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Don’t worry… I already saw," I murmured, and walked to the fountain again, stumbling in the awkward weight of a new body.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The outfit wasn’t half bad. The cloak matched the tunic surprisingly well, and despite the snugness of the tights, the ensemble felt... wearable. My hair now sat neatly in a ponytail, though the bangs still fell annoyingly in front of my eyes. Still, I cracked a small smile. Zelda would probably have smiled at me—finally breaking out of the endless forest-green rut of my Kokiri tunic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">But the smile faltered. The thought of Zelda seeing me like this chilled me more than the storm ever could. I hated this—hated the idea of her witnessing what I had become. Would she pity me? Look away in horror? Or worse, not recognize me at all? That fear burrowed deep, colder than the cave air. And yet, wallowing wouldn't help. I gritted my teeth, forced a grin, and made a ridiculous face on the fountain’s surface, hoping humor could ward off the shame.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey loverboy! Why don't you just marry yourself already?" Tatl teased, her voice laced with nervous humor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I sighed and shook my head. It could’ve been worse. I could’ve been turned into a tree.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">At least I wasn’t </span>
      <span class="c4">completely</span>
      <span class="c0"> female... not yet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">But there was no telling how far the curse would go.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl buzzed impatiently, nudging me toward the exit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I grabbed the Great Fairy’s bow and slung it across my back. With one final look at the empty fountain, I turned and followed Tatl out into the storm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">It was time to find the Skull Kid—and if I was to end this nightmare, I had to start now...before it consumed me completely.</span>

      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">Unexpected Complications</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">The sky was still dark with brooding clouds when we exited the fairy fountain, although the rain had ceased for the time being. I still couldn't see anyone around, but I heard the whooping of children playing in the distance. A chill breeze rustled through the rain-soaked trees, tussling my now tied-back lengths of hair. I heard Tatl's fluttering wings come up behind me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh thank the gods it stopped raining!" she twittered in glee. "I hate the rain. It may not be a big deal to you humans, but for fairies it's like flying through a rushing river!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I looked up to the clouded skies, trying to spot the sun to get an idea of what time it was. My heart sank like a stone into a well. Looming between the parting storm clouds was the moon—closer than ever, its monstrous face twisted in rage. Its glare pressed down like a curse etched into the sky. The mask salesman hadn't been exaggerating. This world was truly doomed... and I was trapped inside its fate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Link!" Tatl shouted. "Look at the—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I know, I know! I saw it." I cut her off, the higher pitch of my voice still jarring in my ears. "We need to find a way to the Star Chamber, and fast!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl quivered and nodded. "Ok ok... ummm... I'm pretty sure it's located just outside of town."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That's a good start. Let's hurry!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We rushed away toward the park exit, off to find a town gate. The drenched dirt path through the park was slippery with wet mud. The mud sucked at my boots with each step, cold and thick like river sludge, clinging to my legs and slowing me to a crawl. I tried to keep up with Tatl as she led the way, but the slog dragged me back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey, slow down!" I called to the retreating fairy. "These boots weren't made for trekking through mud!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl reduced her speed. "Geez, do I need to drag you again?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ughhh really? I do not need your sarcasm right now! I'm having a bad enough day as it is."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Right... sorry." The fairy muttered and flew to my side. "Ok, how about this. You let me ride on your shoulder and I'll point you in the right direction. That way I'll be able to finally rest and you won't have to struggle to keep up?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Right. I had forgotten that Tatl had lugged around my heavy gear all morning. The poor sprite must have been exhausted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I bobbed my head in agreement and stopped to extend my shoulder toward the white fairy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Alright, I don't see why not if it makes it easier on both of us. Hop on."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl plopped down on my shoulder and sighed with gratitude, happy to finally get a chance to rest her exhausted wings. Her tiny weight was barely noticeable, but the quiet companionship it offered grounded me more than I expected. For the first time in a while, I didn’t feel entirely alone in this shifting, unraveling body.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok. So go towards that corridor over there," she began, pointing to one of the passageways we went through yesterday. "Then we're going to make a right and follow that road all the way down to the west side. That's the nearest gate that leads out of town."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">I followed her instructions and began noticing something strange around the city. Instead of the hustle and bustle we dealt with the day before, the streets were nearly deserted. It could have been the rain, but I doubted that a little bad weather would prevent people from preparing for a huge, annual festival. The locals must have noticed the diresome moon in the sky as well. I sensed a general uneasiness while plodding through the wet streets... The few people I did see moved quickly, heads down, their voices hushed as if afraid to draw attention from the sky.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The stillness set me on edge. It felt like the whole town was holding its breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The town was ripe with fear.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As we entered a new district and neared one of the gates, I noticed it was protected by an ironclad, spear-wielding guard. A large visor covered the soldier's face, but his stance betrayed his state of mind. The gate guard was nervously clutching his weapon with a white-knuckle grip, staring up at the sky. The man's behavior confirmed my suspicions. If others had noticed the moon, then widespread panic wasn't far behind. I was running out of time, but if the Star Chamber was nearby, I could quickly find the Skull Kid and stop him before chaos ensued.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I approached the gate, preparing to leave the town, when the guard moved to block me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'm sorry, er… young lady," the guard said, hesitating for just a beat too long before raising his hand to stop me. "It's far too dangerous for a kid like you to be journeying outside the town right now."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I opened my mouth in anger and scowled at the mocking soldier, momentarily forgetting my cursed appearance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c4">Young lady! Who was he calling young lady?!</span>
      <span class="c0"> I thought bitterly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey, what do you mean we can't leave? We've got a bow!" Tatl berated the guard. "We can defend ourselves just fine!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'm sorry, orders from Captain Viscen. I can't allow anyone out of the city walls unless they have official business or are perceived to be capable of defending themselves." The gate guard turned his helmeted head upward. "The mayor sees the moon as a bad omen, and all sorts of monsters have been seen prowling the fields just outside the walls. He ordered the captain to cordon off all the town gates."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"I </span>
      <span class="c4">am</span>
      <span class="c0"> capable of protecting myself!" I retorted, exasperated. "And I do have business with the astronomer at the Star Chamber! So get out of my way!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I was rapidly losing patience, and his snide "young lady" comment had made me more irritable. I felt my cheeks flush with anger and balled my fists, preparing for a fight. Tatl tugged roughly on my ponytail, making me wince from the sharp pain. Yet, the gesture reminded me that I really did look like a young lady. Tatl knew what I was thinking... I relaxed my fists and slowly eased my tense shoulders.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Was I really so changed that even a trained guard mistook me for someone else entirely?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'm not letting you pass, ma'am. Now back off before I'm forced to detain you for disrespecting the law!" the unfazed guard said firmly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I glared and reluctantly pulled away from the gate. I couldn't believe my bad luck! Ever since I encountered that Skull Kid in the woods, my world had been completely turned upside down, and things were only growing steadily worse. I should have never left Hyrule… I should have just stayed and settled down to a normal, quiet life like Zelda advised me to do six years ago. Maybe this was the Goddesses' way of punishing me—not just for leaving the royal family, but for leaving her. For choosing the sword over her hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I reached up to massage my temples in frustration. I would just have to find another way to the astronomer. I had no other choice if I wanted to return to Hyrule, as well as back to my original form….</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok Tatl...do you have any other ideas?" I sighed, turning my head to glance at the little white fairy riding along my shoulder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl thought for a second, then replied, "Didn't the Great Fairy say something about a secret route to the Star Chamber? That a group of kids use for their hideout?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I wearily shrugged. "I dunno... I guess I remember her saying something like that? There was a lot on my mind at the time. I suppose we'd better go look around and try to find this gang then."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl twinkled in agreement, her glow pulsing softly as she settled once more on my shoulder. Her tiny form was encased in a delicate orb of white light, faintly tinged with lavender, her wings shimmering like dew-soaked glass. She looked like a fragment of starlight brought to life, flickering with restless energy even at rest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We walked down the well-maintained street. This part of town was more refined than the other districts we passed through. The cobblestone streets were clear of debris and better maintained, with fewer potholes lying about. Neat rows of small, groomed trees and flowers filled the medians centered in the roads. Large decorative buildings lined the immaculate street, statues and fountains gleaming at every corner. The few people meandering around the lavish district wore fancy, expensive-looking clothing and carried themselves with reckless arrogance. There were far more armored soldiers patrolling this area as well. Quite a few of them guarded a red-bricked, slate-roofed building with several well-nurtured plants positioned beside the doors. A tin and copper sign hung above the door, reading "Mayor's Office." A few of the haughty passersby gave me curious looks. I tried to ignore them and started walking away from the irritating residents.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Link! Look over there!" Tatl excitedly chimed. "Could that be one of the boys the Great Fairy mentioned?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I glanced in the direction Tatl gestured. A boy, probably just entering his teen years, ducked inside one of the alleyways between buildings. I swiftly and silently followed behind, trying not to be obvious. The alleyway was cast in shadow, but there was still enough light to see clearly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The kid wore a dark blue jacket and a round, matching blue cap, with grungy brown hair peeking beneath it. I couldn't quite see his face, but noticed he had a large number "twelve" stitched onto the back of his jacket. He had on grubby tan shorts and his shoes were badly worn. The boy was a short distance down the alley when he suddenly turned around a corner, and I rushed to pursue before I lost him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The passage the young lad disappeared through was empty—somehow, he was nowhere in sight. I ran to catch up to him further down the way when I heard a voice ring out.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey! Why are ya followin' me?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I halted, startled by the voice, nearly causing Tatl to fall from my shoulder. I turned to see the kid pointing a loaded slingshot up at my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Are ya crazy, girly? Or just askin' for trouble? I don't care much for being chased around!" the gang member threatened.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The kid was half my height, maybe a smidgeon taller than my waist. His face was covered in filth, and he looked to be missing a tooth in his mischievous grin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'm not here to cause trouble, kid," I cautiously explained. "I'm just following you because I needed to ask you something."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The boy lowered his slingshot and tilted his head in curiosity.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah? Here to ask me handsome self on a date, eh?" the street urchin winked. "Sorry, not interested... you're far too fancible for my tastes, heh heh."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">A flash of anger and revulsion crossed my face. </span>
      <span class="c4 c12">If my face could melt off from secondhand embarrassment and fury, it probably would have right there in the alley.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Urrghh...look you little twerp, I—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"We need to get to the Star Chamber!" Tatl interrupted. "The Great Fairy sent us!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Confusion showed on the kid's face. "The Great Fairy? Uhhh... well... I'm really not allowed to tell you about the secret hideout…" He motioned for us to come closer and whispered, "But if the Great Fairy told you, then you must have a good reason to know. But only club members are allowed in…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I closed my eyes and shook my head. If I was going to find the Skull Kid, it looked like I’d have to play by their ridiculous little "club" rules.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">"Alright alright, fine…" I sighed. "How do I join?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The dirty scamp laughed, "Haha only boys can join, girls aren't allowed! Well…. normally anyway. But if the Great Fairy sent you, we could maybe make an exception. She's always taking care of us Bombers, so you must be somethin' special."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The words hit me like a slap. Only boys? My stomach twisted with bitter irony. Just a few days ago, I wouldn’t have thought twice about qualifying. Now, standing there in this unfamiliar body, hearing the word "girl" thrown at me again and again—even in jest—it stung worse than I expected. I clenched my jaw, swallowing the surge of heat behind my eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Okaaayyy? So can I join?" I asked once more, losing my patience.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"It ain't my place to say. I'm pretty new myself." The young punk shrugged. "You'll have to talk to our leader. That's pretty much the only way you can get in."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Where do I find him?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Uhhh, he should be practicing his blowdart gun on the roof of the Stockpot Inn." He put a grimy finger against his lips. "But you didn't hear that from me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And with that, the disheveled rascal gave me one last wink and dashed away. I rolled my eyes and faintly smiled. The kid had spunk. I had to give him that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl called out to thank the receding figure, then faced me. "Ok, let's hurry to the Inn, Link! It's not far."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The tiny passenger tugged on my hair again, causing me to recoil.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Owww! Would you stop that? I'm not a horse!" I shrieked as I walked back to the main street. "That does NOT feel good! How would you like it if I pulled on your wings?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Alright alright...fine, I'm sorry." Tatl chuckled, stroking the ponytail between her tiny fingers. "It's just that it feels so nice and soft! Like spun silk... it's kind of mesmerizing." Her voice held a snarky flicker of affection, a note of levity that made the moment feel strangely warm despite the chaos surrounding us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah well, maybe you wouldn't find it so funny if I just tore your wings off…then we'll see who's laughing." I muttered under my breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We rejoined the cobbled street just as the drizzle returned, light and whispering. My boots splashed quietly through shallow puddles as we moved, trying to blend into the background. I stopped to watch the few townsfolk shuffle to their destinations, trying to retreat from the coming rain. A large, balding man dressed in farmer's overalls suddenly barged into me, knocking the breath out of my lungs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Watch yourself, you clumsy runt!" He shouted angrily and stalked off towards the gate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl had been flung off of her perch and I was kneeling on the ground, winded and gasping for air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You watch it, you donkey's anus!" Tatl bellowed out after him. "Link! Are you ok?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She flew down to check on me as I tried to regain my composure. My eyes were welling with tears from the strength of the blow. I felt the fairy's tiny hand gently pat my back while I struggled to breathe.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Urrghhh—</span>
      <span class="c4">gasp</span>
      <span class="c7 c6">—what is WITH THESE PEOPLE?!" I wheezed, rage swelling alongside the ache in my ribs. "If one more idiot so much as </span>
      <span class="c4">looks</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> at me the wrong way, </span>
      <span class="c4">gasp</span>
      <span class="c0"> I swear I'll beat them senseless!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">It seemed like the entire town was full of jerks, I started to consider not saving them after all. But it was not in my nature to give up so easily. Whether I liked it or not, I had to help them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey hey, don't worry about them right now. They're all worthless cowards. Don't waste your anger on them. Just focus on finding Skull Kid. Then you can do whatever you want."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I righted myself and put a hand on my chest to steady my nerves. Feeling the soft, bulbous tissue that had developed there, I immediately removed it in disgust. I looked up at the sky, where the dim silhouette of the sun was nearing the horizon, casting long, cold shadows that seemed to stretch toward me like grasping fingers. The deepening dusk pressed against my senses, stirring a restless urgency in my chest—each passing moment another inch stolen by the encroaching night. Seeing that we were quickly running out of daylight, Tatl and I set off towards the inn...</span>

    <h1 class="c25" id="h.vp0abfexglbo">
      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">The Stockpot Inn</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl hid beneath my heavy cloak, guiding me toward the Stockpot Inn as a rising sense of desperation twisted in my gut. My legs ached, my thoughts were fogged with exhaustion, and I clung to the thought of shelter like a lifeline. Just stepping inside—even if only for a moment—felt like the only thing keeping me upright. The billowing clouds had kept their promise—rain now poured in sheets, relentless and cold. Heavy winds howled through the streets, rocking the signs and shuttered windows that clung to the sides of shops and homes. Rivulets of water streamed down the mostly empty cobblestone roads, and the sun had already begun its descent behind the storm-darkened horizon. I was soaked to the bone, my recently grown hair plastered annoyingly to my cheeks and brow. The new deerskin boots squelched with each step, cold water trapped inside. It was getting colder by the minute, and I prayed we’d arrive at the inn soon. I doubted the leader of the so-called "Bombers" would still be there—if they were even real—but at this point, just being indoors felt like a victory. The added possibility of sleeping in a dry, comfortable bed stirred my aching legs to move faster. I hadn’t slept in a bed since I left Hyrule weeks ago.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Left—now!" Tatl shouted, nearly drowned out by the wind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I quickly turned down one of the narrower side streets. This neighborhood was packed with restaurants, small shops, and a couple of dimly lit game houses. A few determined customers milled about beneath umbrellas, their faces obscured by hoods and shadows.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Which way next?!" I called, squinting through the downpour.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"It should be just up ahead! Right around that corner! I hope..." replied the soaked and slightly panicked fairy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A jagged bolt of lightning split the sky, casting the alley in stark white light for a heartbeat. A bone-rattling crack of thunder followed, loud enough to make me flinch. The shock reverberated through my ribs like distant thunder made flesh, clashing against the cold tension already curled tight in my chest like a coiled spring. I quickened my pace, my breath steaming in the chilled air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Slowing as I turned the corner, not wanting to slip, I finally spotted our destination through the downpour. The Stockpot Inn stood tall: a three-story structure of timber and stone. A large, weatherworn sign—"Welcome to the Stockpot Inn"—swayed slightly above the entryway.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Grateful for the shelter, I jogged the last few steps and reached for the handle. As I pushed the door open, a wave of warm, sweet-smelling air spilled out, thick with the scent of old wood and dried herbs. I huffed droplets of water off my nose, sighing in relief. Tatl zipped from beneath my cloak with a grumble, shaking off rain like a disgruntled cat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Inside, the flickering light of wall sconces bathed the room in a welcoming glow that clashed tenderly with the storm still howling outside. The warmth seeped into my chilled limbs, softening the knots of tension in my shoulders, and for a fleeting moment, I felt like I had stepped into a dream—a fragile pocket of peace where the world couldn’t reach me. I trudged to the front desk, boots squishing and dripping with each step. A thin, auburn-haired woman with gentle blue eyes looked up and smiled warmly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hello there, welcome to the Stockpot Inn... Oh my! You poor dear, you must be soaked to the bone! Are you by chance looking for a room? Normally we would be booked solid due to the Carnival, but with everything going on in Termina... well, not many have come to celebrate this year. Lucky for you, we have quite a few rooms available."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My face lit up. "Yeah, that would be great! Are there any fireplaces in the rooms?" I asked, already imagining my gear drying beside a crackling hearth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Another rumble of thunder echoed in the distance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, we have three rooms that come with a fireplace. But I’m afraid they’ve all been reserved... Hmm, let me double-check." The woman ducked beneath the counter and pulled out a large, leather-bound guestbook. Behind her, a decorative wall clock ticked steadily, the sound a soft anchor against the storm outside.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She flipped through the pages. "Hmm... yes, unfortunately, those rooms do appear to be taken... Mmm, wait just a moment. Oh! It looks like we do have one deluxe room available. The guest who reserved it never showed up—but they paid in advance."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She looked back at me with a hint of softness. "You poor dears look like you've had a terrible day. If you'd like, I'd be happy to give you the room—free of charge. It’s already paid for, and in these dark times, I think it’s the least I can do."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yes, oh thank you so much!" I exclaimed, my voice a mix of gratitude and disbelief. "You’re a lifesaver, ma’am!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Maybe my luck was finally starting to turn around.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, you may call me Anju, dear. Allow me to grab your keys. I’ll be right back."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She disappeared into the back and returned moments later holding a ring of keys.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Alright, if you’ll follow me, please? I’ll show you to your room."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I trailed after her, boots still squelching, leaving faint puddles behind on the polished wood floor. Tatl hovered beside me, her glow reflecting in little halos across the damp surface. I paused for a moment, instinctively searching for a towel or rug to wipe my feet, but Anju turned on the stairs and caught my hesitation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, don’t worry about that, sweetie. I’ll clean it up after I show you to your room."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Candles flickered in lanterns lining the stairwell, their flames bobbing with each passing gust from the old drafty halls. The steps creaked under our weight, worn smooth by decades of use. Though aged, the inn was immaculately clean—its air tinged with the earthy scent of dried sage and cedar, and the faint, rhythmic creaking of wood beneath our steps gave the space a sense of living history, like the house itself breathed in time with the storm outside. Its bones weathered, but clearly cared for. Dust-free corners, fresh-swept floorboards, and serene paintings of forests and rivers gave it the quiet charm of a place loved by generations.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A loud crack of thunder shook the halls as we reached the top floor. Anju ignored the sudden burst of sound and turned left, down the small corridor, and stopped at the first door we came to.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Your room is here..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The innkeeper unlocked the door and gestured through to the room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I walked through the doorway and examined the room. The chamber was cozy and inviting. A clean, welcoming bed with neatly folded blankets sat on the left side of the room. A lantern burned brightly on the bedside table, cheerfully illuminating the space. A small, unlit fireplace was built into the wall opposite the bed, its mantel finely crafted and smooth to the touch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Wow, this is pretty snazzy!" Tatl chimed. "I rarely ever get to stay in places like this!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh yes, we do try to accommodate our guests as much as we can," Anju replied, handing me the room key and sauntering over to the fireplace, striking a match to light it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Now then, checkout is usually at noon... but with all these bad omens plaguing the city, you may stay as long as you like. Something tells me you need the peace of mind. The gods only know that everyone needs a reprieve from hardship every once in a while..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The pretty innkeeper suddenly expressed sadness in her eyes, and she seemed to grow distant, as though she stared across a salt-grey sea of silent burdens. Apparently I wasn't the only one having a bad day. I tried to smile to comfort her and show my immeasurable gratitude.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Thank you so much, Miss Anju! I won't ever forget your incredible kindness. If there's anything I can do for you, let me know... and I will do all that is in my power to help," I vowed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh... no, don't worry about me... I must apologize, I've been a terrible hostess!" Anju blinked, snapping back to reality. She bowed courteously and backed out of the room. "Please let me know if there's anything else you need, Miss...? I'm so sorry, I don't believe I caught your name! How impossibly rude of me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ummm, it's... it's Link," I hesitantly answered and pointed to Tatl, who had already begun to warm herself by the fire. "And that's Tatl over there."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ah, those are good names," Anju nodded. "Well then, please excuse me. I truly hope you both have a relaxing and pleasant stay. Again, welcome to the Stockpot Inn."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The door gently closed behind the retreating hostess, and I listened to the faint tapping of her shoes fading into the distance. I looked down at my drenched outfit and unslung my bow, placing it beside the cleanly folded blankets. I was still freezing, the fabric clinging to me like a second skin, and I was quite anxious to be dry. I moved toward the warm, inviting glow of the fireplace. The fire crackled merrily, casting dancing shadows on the walls and sending out gentle waves of heat that clashed with the tension still curled deep in my muscles.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Aren't you going to change out of those clothes? They're still drenched, you know? And you're dripping all over this nice floor!" Tatl voiced. "Go ahead and take them off. Don't worry, I won't look. I have absolutely no desire to see naked humans."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The white fairy turned her back to me and covered her eyes. I sighed and reluctantly began to strip down. My gloves and cloak plopped to the floor. The moisture had glued the wet shirt and pants to my skin, making them difficult to peel off. I tried my best to look away as I wrestled with the leggings and boots, not wanting to see my feminized figure. Every brush of fabric against my skin reminded me that this body wasn’t mine anymore. I had begun to feel sick to my stomach and didn't want to think about the curse. I just wanted warmth and a quiet night to recover. I could find the club leader in the morning, though I knew I was on a tight schedule. Since darkness had fallen, the kid had probably turned in for the evening anyway.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Pulling the soaked shirt over my head, I was finally free of the cloying garments. I moved to the bed to grab one of the blankets and unfolded the thick, wool comforter, draping it over my shoulders. Its scratchy warmth dug deep into my bones like the sun after a storm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I huffed and plucked the dripping pile of clothing off the floor. I carried them over to the fireplace and positioned them so that they would effectively dry off. The fire hissed softly in greeting as the droplets sizzled away. Satisfied, I shifted over to the cushioned chair and sat down, wrapping the blanket tighter around myself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok Tatl, you can look now," I informed, and scooted the chair closer to the crackling fire. Finally feeling its warmth wash over me, I smiled with fragile relief. Aside from the lingering nausea and weariness, I was at ease—if only for a moment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I relaxed, taking in the strange circumstances of the past few days. This was one of the most stressful series of events I had ever experienced. I had never once, in my wildest dreams, thought that I would be turned into a girl. And not just turned—becoming. Piece by piece, and hour by hour. The fact that this was really happening, and what the near future might bring, unnerved me. What if I never returned to normal? What if I changed even more?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl interrupted my downward spiral into a helpless panic by breaking the silence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"So, what about the leader of the Bomber Gang?" Tatl asked, "Did you already forget?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, Tatl, I didn't forget... I just need to sit down for a bit. I'm still trying to get used to this body, and my insides are still churning from this morning."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Aww come on, it can't be that bad," she replied, her wings twitching with amusement. "Besides, it could be worse. Skull Kid could have just turned you into a Deku stick! Or a cow... heheheh."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Shut up. Just... just don't... not right now..." I muttered, a tired smile threatening to form. As much as I hated to admit it, her ridiculous jokes were starting to grow on me. Her teasing felt less like mockery and more like... comfort, in its own backwards way.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Pfft... fine. Can't take a joke..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I ignored her and shut my eyes. Tatl was definitely the first fairy I'd met that had so much... personality. I was a bit curious about why she was so abrasive, but I was mentally exhausted. My eyes closed, and the warmth of the crackling fireplace pulled me into its cocoon. The flickering glow clashed against the cold still clinging to my limbs, the tension coiled in my muscles refusing to melt. That comfort, faint as it was, lulled me into a deep, but restless sleep...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I dreamt of returning to Hyrule, of riding a horse through vast fields of wind-blown grass wavering underneath a clear, blue sky. I gallantly rode in triumph towards the glistening castle town in the distance. Flocks of birds passed by overhead as I spurred the horse beneath me to gallop faster, but no matter how fast it went, the castle seemed to recede ever further into the distance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Suddenly, the wind slowed. The sky grew dark, and a huge shadow eclipsed Hyrule Castle. The birds scattered. A chill surged through me. I turned my gaze upward, and my heart froze. The moon—its monstrous, furious face leering—was plunging toward the castle. Its eyes wept silvery tears and its surface pulsed with molten cracks. Screaming erupted from behind the white ramparts as it plummeted faster and faster!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Time slowed. The land held its breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Then—it smashed into the earth with cataclysmic force. Waves of dust and fire rolled across the land like a storm of death. I was thrown from the horse, the shock wave hitting me like a giant’s fist. I hit the ground, gasping, and scrambled to my feet, trying to flee. But the wave caught me. I was swallowed in a maelstrom of debris.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I clenched my eyes against the clouds of ash. The air burned in my lungs. Then—</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Suddenly it wasn’t ash anymore. I was choking on hair.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Massive tendrils of hair lashed all around me—silky, shining, and alive. They wrapped around my limbs with serpentine grace, tangled in my mouth, forced their way down my throat. I tried to scream, but the strands pressed deeper, muffling me, smothering me. The air smelled like lavender and rot. My arms were pinned. My legs tangled. Each movement only dragged me deeper into the silken prison.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">No sword. No voice. No self. Just silk and silence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Darkness overtook me. Somewhere, far away, someone called my name.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Link!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The voice was urgent, desperate, calling out again and again. But I was sinking, drowning in this fibrous sea. I reached one final time, my fingers stretching toward the light—</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>—</span>
      <span class="c0">and then, I was swallowed whole.</span>

      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">Dawn of the Final Day</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My eyes snapped open and I screamed in panic. The contents of my stomach lurched up into my throat and I keeled over, vomiting a stream of clear fluid beside the chair. Tatl frantically twinkled over me, reaching down to try to hold my hair back while I dry heaved, then slumped back into the chair, weak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My forehead was damp with cold sweat, and flecks of vomit dotted the wool blanket, still bundled around me. The fire in the fireplace had died to smoldering embers, but the room was still brightly illuminated by the bedside lantern.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Link, are you alright?!" Tatl cried in shock, releasing my hair. "You were tossing and turning in your sleep, mumbling something about hair."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I wiped my mouth on the blanket and groaned, still nauseous, and feebly nodded in response to Tatl. "Uggghhhhh...yeah. I think I'll be fine. I just had a... terrible nightmare. No big deal. What time is it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I dunno, probably not yet dawn...are you sure you're ok?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I leaned up and looked at the fairy. I felt a little off balance, but I repeated myself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yes, I'll be ok. Thank you for your concern though..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Pfft, I wasn't concerned! I just want you to be able to beat the Skull Kid is all," Tatl sneered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I rolled my eyes and sighed. It was not easy to get a read on Tatl. It was as if she had a switch that flipped from prickly and sarcastic to nurturing and kind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok sheesh! Sorry I said anything..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I muttered and attempted to stand, but fell back into the chair with an unexpected shift of balance. Was I suddenly changed even more?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Uhhhh...Tatl? Did I go through more...changes?" I asked, not wanting to check myself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl drifted close to my face to study my features, then she quickly looked away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, I don't think so... uhhh... If anything you look more rested. Still, maybe you should wait before you start moving around, just to calm your nerves." The pixie replied with a nervous glance, but quickly changed the subject. "Oh, but good news! Your clothes are all dry. I threw them onto the bed while you were passed out. They're ready to go, and now that you're up we should be too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I glanced back to the clothes on the bed and smiled faintly. I knew there was more to Tatl than her abrasive personality and sarcasm—there was a soft spot hidden beneath that sassy exterior after all.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, how nice of you," I smirked, voice still hoarse. "You know... you've been a huge help to me these past couple days. If it weren't for you... well, I probably wouldn't have lasted this long, so... thank you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Now now, don't get all mushy on me. Remember, I'm only sticking around until I'm reunited with my brother!" Tatl lectured, though her light flickered with a quiet warmth. "It's getting late, and we still have to find that gang leader. First things first, you need to get dressed. Can you stand up now?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah, I think so. Shouldn't be too much of a problem..." I answered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I leaned forward and shakily stood, still bundled in the blanket. I managed to find my balance and tentatively walked to the bed. My body swayed after each step, my equilibrium becoming momentarily unstable. My gut was still squeamish, and I felt lightheaded, but I crossed the room to the bed with little consequence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok, I'm taking off the blanket, Tatl," I warned.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Trust me, I'm not looking... blech! Do your thing already."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I steeled my nerves with a deep breath and slowly unwrapped the blanket, letting it drop to the floor. A chill wafted across my body and I shivered, wrapping my arms around myself. My palms met soft, unfamiliar curves. My breath hitched, and I recoiled instinctively, horror rising in my throat like bile.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Ample bosoms now rested on my chest—weighty and alien, large enough to disrupt my posture and balance. Even my arms had slimmed to match my delicate hands, their strength stripped away and replaced with elegance I didn’t recognize.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I gasped aloud, my throat tightening as I stepped back. The movement jostled my chest, triggering a disorienting bounce that sent a shiver through my spine.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh gods... no... no no, please nooo..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I trembled, unable to stop myself from looking. My eyes trailed downward past the unfamiliar mounds of flesh, following the unmistakable hourglass curve of my torso to the place I had been dreading. What had once defined my identity below the waist had vanished, replaced by a smoothness I couldn’t even bear to comprehend.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I slapped a hand over my mouth, stifling the cry that threatened to escape. My breathing turned shallow, panicked, each breath a sharp edge slicing through my ribs. My heart pounded like a war drum, and nausea rose in waves until the room tilted beneath me. I staggered back a step, barely catching myself on the nearby bedpost before collapsing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The realization crashed through me with the weight of a landslide. This wasn’t just a curse anymore—it was a complete metamorphosis. I had become a woman.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tears welled in my eyes, blurring the room, and I clutched my face in trembling hands.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"This... can't be happening... This can't be happening!" I rasped, rocking slightly as I tried to keep from falling apart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl’s voice broke through the fog. "H-Hey, is everything OK over there?" she called out, her voice taut with concern. "Is something wrong? Link?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I couldn’t bring myself to answer. I was unraveling from the inside out.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, no, no, no! Don't! Don't look, Tatl... please... I'm... I'm ok!" I replied, my voice thick with emotion, trying to hold myself together by the thinnest of threads.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You sure? You don’t sound—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I’m fine!" I cut her off too sharply, too fast. The silence that followed was heavy, but she didn’t press me further.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My fingers trembled as I reached for the clothes on the bed. Every motion was slow, like I was underwater—adrift in a body I didn’t recognize, aching to wake from a dream I couldn’t escape.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I managed to find the shirt and threw it over my head, thrusting my arms through the sleeves. Pulling it over my uncomfortable breasts, I let the garment fall to its length below my hips, covering my groin, then reopened my eyes. I reached for the tight black pants next with shaking hands and quickly pulled them on over my now smooth legs. The leggings were much more comfortable now, and far less constraining. My legs must have lost even more muscle mass...along with the hair that once covered them! The tight pants were snug and form fitting along my now dismally flat waist.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A few tears fell upon the bed, and a few strands of, noticeably more auburn, hair dangled before my eyes. I swept a hand over my face wiping the tears and hair away, and quickly snatched one of the light deerskin boots. I lifted my foot to slip it inside and managed to get it halfway through, when I suddenly lost balance. I couldn't catch myself and yelped as my rump painfully crashed to the hard wooden floor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Link! Are you alright!?" Tatl exclaimed. She gasped and sped over to me. "What hap ...?" The fairy inspected me closely, and surprise filled her face as she realized that the curse had fully run its course. "Ohhh...I see...I'm sorry. Are you...ok though?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"N -no..." I sobbed uncontrollably, finally overcome by despair. "L -look at me! What do I do now? Why is this happening to me?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl didn’t speak at first. She hovered close in gentle silence, her glow dimming to a soft shimmer. After a moment, she gently said, "Ummm... maybe you should lie down on the bed... just for a minute. Catch your breath."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I let out a bitter scoff between gasps, clutching at the boot I’d dropped. "Lie down? Are you joking? Right... because there's no way I'm going to save myself now, huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, that's not what I meant..." she said quickly, fluttering closer. "Look, it’s not over yet! We can still change you back—and save my brother, OK? All we gotta do is find your instrument."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah... because that’s going to be so simple now," I muttered, swiping at my cheeks with the back of my glove. The tears had slowed, but the sting remained.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl hesitated, her voice quieter. "Not really. Not unless you want to be that way forever. Are you... going to be okay? Do you need some time?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'm fine. Or... I will be," I snapped, forcing the words through clenched teeth. My voice trembled despite my bravado. "As soon as I totally destroy that masked, impish idiot. This is only a temporary setback!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">There was a pause, then a cautious flutter from behind. "Umm... well. If you're sure you're okay... we should probably be on our way. I don’t think we have much time left. I was woken up by the earth quaking just before you started talking in your sleep."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Her concern wasn’t lost on me. She didn’t push further. Just floated there, giving me space. And strangely... that helped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I gave a stiff nod, wiping the lingering tears on my sleeve. Sighing, I slid the boot fully on and rose to my feet, wincing at the dull ache still blooming in my tailbone. I sat back on the bed to finish dressing, slipping on the second boot and shrugging into my cloak. After tugging on my fingerless gloves, I glanced around the room, my eyes landing on the crumpled mess near the chair.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I scooped up the blanket I had used, tossing it over the puddle near the chair. Thankfully, there were no signs of vomit—just water and tears. I silently thanked the Great Fairy's magic for quelling my hunger. Anju didn’t deserve to clean up after me. She already carried too many burdens.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I flinched suddenly as a sharp tug jolted the back of my head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Owww! Tatl! What did I say about doing that?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hold... still, Link! Your hair's a disaster again!" the fairy chirped, her tiny hands working through my tangled locks. "Just let me... fix it... THERE! All done, you big baby."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I shot her a glare, rubbing the sore spot while she smugly tousled my bangs and floated back with a triumphant hum. I raised a gloved hand to my face and shook my head. She really could be a pain… but she stayed. And that meant something.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Despite everything, I gave her a faint smile.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Let's just get going," I muttered, pulling my bow from the bed and slinging it across my back. "We have a long day ahead."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I turned down the lamp, wiped away what remained of the mess, and gave the room a final once-over. Satisfied, I locked the door behind us as Tatl hovered beside me, her glow steady and quiet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We made our way back downstairs when we suddenly heard a loud crash coming from the first-floor hallway. I dashed downstairs and through the hall in the direction of the clatter. Upon hearing Anju's voice, I halted. It sounded like she was talking to someone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Jim! Why are you always causing trouble?! Don't you think we have enough going on right now? Put that ridiculous thing away and clean up your mess!" An exasperated Anju scolded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey, don't yell at me, I'm just trying to learn how to protect us! You never know when a weapon will come in handy. Especially after the moon falls and the survivors are fighting for food and water!" a prepubescent boy defended.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I inched closer to see if I could try to peek at whom Anju was speaking to.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You need to stop with these awful fantasies of yours. It's going to get you into even more trouble with mother. And if the moon does fall, well... there likely won't be anyone left...so stop being a brat and just grow up, Jim!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Had I been paying attention to the floor, I would have noticed the loose floorboard jutting up. But instead, I caught it with the toe of my boot and stumbled forward, trying to cover a surprised whoop. They noticed me anyway, and the conversation stopped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey, who's out there!" the boy challenged into the hall. "Show yourself before I give you a dart sandwich!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That's enough, Jim!" Anju chided. "It's ok, don't be frightened. Jim has more bark than he does bite..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I reluctantly stepped from behind the corner. Anju was with a clearly related redheaded boy half her size, who pointed a long blowgun at me. They stood in what I presumed to be the inn's large kitchen. Pots, pans, and tiny ball-pointed darts littered the black-and-white tile floor. A fire blazed in the oven, with a kettle boiling on the stove that was full of...something. Various vegetables were strewn across a table opposite the room. Anju and the boy were beside a large island table that sat in the middle of the room, with knives stuck into the wood.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh! Miss Link! I'm so sorry if we woke you!" Anju exclaimed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, no, I was... already awake," I assured, trying to compose myself. "I was just coming down when I heard voices and..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"And what? You always go snooping in other people’s business, lady?" Jim scowled, arms crossed defiantly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Anju narrowed her eyes. "Mind your manners, you degenerate child! This is our guest and she will be treated as such."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She turned back to me with a sigh. "Please don’t mind him, Miss Link. This is my kid brother, Jim. He can be... difficult. I hope no offense was taken?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, it’s alright, ma’am, really," I replied gently. "I just wanted to make sure everything was okay."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Anju softened. "Oh, everything’s fine, thank you. And how did you sleep, my dear? If I may say so, it looks like a full night’s rest did wonders! You almost look like an entirely new person."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I gave a weary smile, brushing a damp strand from my forehead. "Yeah… an entirely new person..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The words tumbled out before I could catch them, soft and haunted. Something cold settled in my chest, like a secret only I could feel. Anju’s eyes flicked toward me, brows knitting with concern. I forced a shaky grin, trying to push away the weight curling in my gut.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"But uhh yes! The room was lovely. I passed out the moment I sat down. Thank you again for your kindness! It really means a lot."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No trouble at all, Miss Link. I just wish I could say the same for my rude brother." Anju reached out and firmly gripped Jim’s red shirt, giving it a meaningful tug.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>“</span>
      <span class="c0">It's fine, really. I've dealt with much worse since coming to this town...trust me. But we had better be going. There's a lot to do, and we're running out of time. Thanks again!" I waved and turned to walk out.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh hey, cool! You have a bow?" the young boy shouted with wide-eyed excitement, practically bouncing on his heels. "That's awesome! Can I see it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Leave her alone, Jim, and clean up this mess! Now!" Anju snapped, casting him a sharp look from behind the counter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I turned around, both Anju and I frowning at the boy, whose enthusiasm visibly deflated. "No, I'm very busy. I need to find a way to the Star Chamber as soon as possible. Playing games is only going to set me back even further."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Without waiting for a response, I turned and started toward the exit, Tatl zipping ahead like a streak of impatient light.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey, wait!" Jim called, sprinting after me. "Did you say the Star Chamber? I can show you how to get in—I know a secret way!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I halted mid-step, and he nearly crashed into me. I turned with narrowed eyes. "A secret way in? Riiight. Let me guess—you’re one of the 'Bombers,' too?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He puffed out his chest proudly. "Ha! You're looking at their leader, lady."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I raised an eyebrow. "Seriously? I was kinda expecting someone a bit... older."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Psshh, we don't let old grown-ups in the club. Or girls, either, usually... but you don’t seem like most girls. You’ve got that... vibe. So maybe I can cut you a deal—not club membership, but if you want into the Star Chamber, I can get you there."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">His casual jab landed deeper than I expected, stinging like salt in a wound I hadn’t realized was open. I stiffened, forcing a sigh through clenched teeth and rolling my eyes in practiced deflection. "Fine. What's the catch?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Jim grinned like a fox who’d just found a chicken coop. "You gotta prove you can use that bow. I’ve got some targets up on the roof. If you can hit them, I’ll show you the secret tunnel. Deal?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I crossed my arms and gave him a flat, tired stare. "Why do you care if I can use it? If you want me to prove I’m tough, I could just throw you through a wall."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He barked a laugh. "I like your style! But nah, what would that prove—besides that you can toss a kid? If you hit my targets, that means you’ve got skill. And that means you’re cool enough to be shown the way."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I glanced at Tatl, still hovering at the end of the hall with her arms crossed and glow pulsing like an impatient lantern. She caught my eye and gave a lopsided grin, the kind that said "well, what’ve you got to lose?" I let out another sigh, this one laced with reluctant amusement, and reached out to shake Jim’s hand. "Alright, deal. But don't get cocky, kid. I'm still deciding whether you're annoying or charming."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Cool! Follow me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Jim burst down the hall and bounded up the stairs with the energy of someone who’d just downed a whole jug of Lon Lon Milk. Tatl and I hurried after him, her wings trailing sparkles of light as we moved.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As I followed the enthusiastic boy, I noticed a large white number stitched boldly onto the back of his red shirt: a proud and defiant "1." It reminded me of the filthy street urchin we’d run into yesterday—his shirt had worn the number "12" in faded, crooked stitching. Jim's crisp, prominent digit made his position as the leader obvious. I didn’t understand these childish rankings and rituals—maybe it was all pretend. Or maybe, in a world constantly threatened by a falling moon, even pretend things needed structure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We reached the top floor quickly. Jim skidded to a stop in front of the last door at the end of the hallway, practically vibrating with excitement.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Okay, it's right here. I’ll have to set everything up first, so hang tight till I come get you. It’ll just be a minute!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He disappeared inside, leaving the door swinging shut behind him. I caught a narrow glimpse of the eastern sky just beginning to pale. The sun hadn’t risen yet, but it wouldn’t be long. That gave me some hope—I still had daylight left to find the Skull Kid. But not much.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A few moments later, the door swung open again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Okay, everything’s all ready. C’mon, let’s go!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl and I stepped out onto the roof and were greeted by the scent of wet shingles and the sharp tang of morning air. Jim led us toward a large brass bell suspended in a weathered wooden frame. Around the rooftop, water-stained balloons were tied to small rocks, their colors dim in the gray-blue light. The inn rose higher than most buildings nearby, offering a broad view of the horizon—though it was a view quickly consumed by the ever-lowering moon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Its grotesque face loomed above like a weight pressing down on the world. Even this high up, I felt smaller than ever beneath it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c20">
      <span class="c0">
        <br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"They say it's going to fall tonight," Jim said. "Is that why you want to go to the Star Chamber? To get front row seats?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No... I just... Look, what do you want me to shoot?" I replied, not really in the mood to explain myself to a kid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Whatever... just shoot those balloons and I'll show you the way in."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I nodded and unslung the bow from my back. My fingers curled instinctively around the polished grip, admiring the artistry in its elegant, swirling inlays. The grain of the wood shimmered faintly, catching the overcast light like it remembered battles of ages past. I gave the silver-flecked string a tentative tug.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Wait a sec, where are your arrows, lady?" Jim asked, squinting up at me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Arrows? Blast it! I had completely forgotten to look for arrows with all the chaos of the last few days. My heart sank, but I masked it with a confident bluff.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Don't worry about them—I know what I'm doing. Just testing the tension."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I lifted the bow, drawing the string with a quiet breath. To my astonishment, as if summoned by will alone, a glowing shaft of light shimmered into existence, neatly nocked and ready to fire. The arrow pulsed faintly with a magic heartbeat, delicate and fierce.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Whoa! No way!" Jim gasped. "You have a magic bow?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I guess I do," I murmured, still stunned. I turned my gaze back to the balloons, steadying my grip. "Okay... let's see what this thing can really do."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I narrowed my focus, clearing my mind. The world stilled as I exhaled slowly and released the shot. The radiant arrow sliced through the air, trailing starlight, and struck the first balloon dead center, popping it with a satisfying bang that echoed like triumph.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That was awesome! Do it again!" Jim cried, bouncing on his toes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I smirked and took aim again. Another breath, another shimmer of light. Two more arrows sang through the sky, bursting the remaining targets in glowing explosions. The bow thrummed softly in my hand, as if whispering approval.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">A deep wave of satisfaction rippled through me. It felt </span>
      <span class="c4">good</span>
      <span class="c7 c6">—</span>
      <span class="c4">right</span>
      <span class="c0">—to fire a bow again. Like I had reconnected with something sacred. Like a piece of myself had returned after days of being lost, warped, twisted into something I am not.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That was AWESOME! YOU'RE AWESOME!" Jim shouted, practically vibrating with excitement. "I gotta say, you have totally earned your passage through to our hideout!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well, it's about time, kid!" Tatl sputtered impatiently, her wings buzzing with restless energy. "Let’s get a move on, then!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well, it's about time, kid!" Tatl sputtered impatiently, her wings buzzing with restless energy. "Let’s get a move on, then!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well aren’t you just full of cheer today. Calm down, fairy—it’s right this way!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Jim backed away from the roof's edge with a few quick steps, then sprinted forward and vaulted across the gap to the next building. The jump was clean, his landing steady, and the streets below remained ghostly and still—darkened storefronts huddled beneath the pale hush of the pre-dawn sky.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"C’mon, let’s go!" he called, hands cupped to his mouth. "What’s the matter—scared?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I rolled my eyes and re-slung the bow across my back. "Hardly," I muttered, stepping back. With a swift run-up, I leapt the distance and landed light on the balls of my feet. The impact jolted my chest, and I winced. Everything jiggled in a way I was still getting used to. I clutched at my tunic for a moment, then released it with a frustrated breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I took a moment to steady myself. I felt faster—more agile than I had the day before—but every motion now came with a heightened sense of self, an uncomfortable awareness that I was still learning to live in. The way my body moved wasn’t wrong exactly... just unfamiliar. Like wearing armor tailored for someone else.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl fluttered across effortlessly, her glow pulsing in rhythm with the breeze.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Awesome! Gosh, it sucks that you’re a girl—you’d make such a great Bomber!" Jim lamented.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A muscle twitched in my jaw. I forced a smirk. "Pfft... tell me about it," I said, my voice dry. "Every day’s a new adventure."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl let out a sharp snort beside me, and I gave her a look that said, 'Not helping.'</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Without answering, Jim pointed to a nearby drain and slid down it with practiced ease, vanishing into the shadows below.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I exchanged a glance with Tatl and shrugged. "Guess we're following the squirrel."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Lead the way, Bombette," she quipped, and I narrowed my eyes at her before stepping forward.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I wrapped my gloved hands around the edge and slid down after him, the rough metal screeching faintly under my boots. I landed clean and crouched low, just in time to see Jim darting off again toward a narrow alleyway that terminated in a brick wall.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We chased after him, water puddles splashing underfoot—when suddenly, the ground quaked. I stumbled, catching myself against the damp wall as a low rumble rolled through the stone and air like a beast growling in its sleep. Tatl’s glow dimmed slightly as she hovered beside me, eyes lifted skyward in alarm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Link, the moon must be causing that! We have to stop the Skull Kid, now!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That's what I'm doing, Tatl—but we can't if we don't even know where he is." The ground finally ceased its trembling, and I resumed the chase, boots crunching over broken debris.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Jim stopped at the end of the alley near a junk pile. As we caught up, he gave a crooked smirk and began heaving a wooden crate to the side.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Okay, it's just this way. You're skinny, so you should have no trouble fitting through here. But don’t tell anyone about this, got it?" Jim warned, glancing over his shoulder. "This is only for people like us to know. I can't make you a member, but I'd say you earned knowing about this secret... not that it really matters much now, huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">With the crate moved, I saw a small tunnel—probably an old sewer drain, just wide enough for someone of my new size. I approached Jim and gave him a nod of thanks before crouching to examine the tunnel’s mouth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hmmm... hey wait! Before you go, I... I want to give you this." Jim reached beneath his shirt and pulled out a cloth badge. "This is proof of membership. It's kinda against the rules of the club to let you in... but I’ve thought it over. The rules don’t mean much when the sky’s falling."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He held it out, and I took it from his small hand. It was thick and circular, the image of a blue bomb stitched on white cloth. A little dirt smudged the edges, but it was whole. The weight of it in my palm surprised me. More than cloth—it felt like respect. Recognition. Inclusion. A gesture that, just days ago, would’ve felt ordinary—now struck a chord somewhere raw and hidden.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Thank you, Jim. This... really means a lot," I said, my voice softening. I held his gaze a moment, then slipped the badge into my belt pouch with care.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey hey, don’t go all emotional on me now!" Jim teased with a grin. "You’ve earned your spot... well, unofficially, anyway. Just don’t tell anyone. I’d get chewed out for letting a girl in the club."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Look at you lowering your standards to our level! Honestly, you're going to make me blush, tough guy," Tatl said with a mock sigh, her wings flickering with mischief as she tugged on my cloak. Her tone was light, a small offering of humor to ease the heaviness of the moment. "Come on, Link. Let’s move before you start crying too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I chuckled faintly, casting Jim one last grateful look. He gave a lopsided salute, all bravado and scrappy courage. Crouching low, I slipped into the tunnel. The crate scraped back into place behind me with a finality that echoed louder than the wind. Darkness embraced me, cool and damp, swallowing the light behind like a memory fading into shadow. Each step forward echoed in my chest—not fear, not courage… just resolve. The unknown waited—and so did my fate.</span>

      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">By the Moon and Stars</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">The dark passageway reeked of rot and runoff. The remnants of yesterday’s storm had left the tunnel drenched, water pooling in crevices and dribbling from the low ceiling in slow, cold droplets. A sharp, rank stench clung to the air—mold, stagnant water, something else decaying in the shadows. I could barely breathe without gagging.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl flitted ahead, her glow faint and wavering, casting nervous shadows that danced across the dripping stone walls. The squeaking of rats echoed distantly, occasionally punctuated by a wet shuffle I tried not to identify. Her tiny form weaved through the narrow crawl space with ease while I slogged after her on hands and knees, gritting my teeth with every cold splash beneath my palms.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">The tunnel was tight—so tight I doubted my original body would have even fit. That thought landed strangely in my chest. The only reason I </span>
      <span class="c4">could</span>
      <span class="c0"> squeeze through was because of what I'd lost… or gained. My new frame was narrower, more compact. Feminine. My long brown tunic was already soaked through, clinging to my curves beneath the forest-green cloak that trailed behind me like moss dragged through a stream. The brown fingerless gloves I wore were damp and gritty, and the black tights did little to protect my knees from the rough stone. My soft deerskin boots—once sleek and supple—were now caked in sludge and soaked to the seams, the tops flopping slightly around my thighs with every awkward shuffle forward. I had been crawling for what felt like hours, my breath shallow, the air thick and sour.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Suddenly, my fingers brushed something damp—and furry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A high-pitched squeal erupted as the creature bolted, its slick body slapping across my hand before vanishing into the dark.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"AGHH—ugh—goddesses!" I recoiled violently, biting back a full-body shudder. The cold cling of fur still lingered on my skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"How are you doing back there?" Tatl called, her voice echoing faintly through the stone throat of the tunnel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'm... urgh… fine," I grunted, though my voice cracked from the strain. My knees were bruised, my arms aching, and a headache was blooming behind my eyes from the foul air and the claustrophobic press of the tunnel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok... hang in there. I think I see a light just up ahead," she said, sounding unsure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Unngh, good… Hopefully that means more space," I muttered, dragging myself forward with a grimace. "I really need to stand up. And this place smells like something died, came back to life, and died again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">Tatl scoffed, but sure enough, I saw a torch flickering like a beacon in the darkness ahead. I felt the ground beneath me gently begin to slope into a shallow decline, and I slid down toward the light. The space around me finally expanded out into a large corridor. I stood up, shaking moisture and mud off my hands, and rested them briefly on my noticeably wider hips. My outfit clung damply to my frame—the long brown tunic darkened by the grime, its hem brushing just above my thighs. My green cloak hung sodden and heavy down my back, water dripping from its edges. The black tights beneath were soaked and streaked with filth, hugging the slim curves of my reshaped legs. My soft deerskin boots squelched with each step, the once supple leather now misshapen with water and muck. I stretched my cramping spine and sighed with relief, then bent down to massage my sore knees.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Feel better?" Tatl teased with a sparkle in her voice. "That looked like a </span>
      <span class="c4">really</span>
      <span class="c0"> tight fit for you. Just think! You would've gotten stuck in there with your old bulky boy-body, haha!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Oh yes... just </span>
      <span class="c4">hilarious</span>
      <span class="c7 c6">," I deadpanned, rising to my feet and wringing moisture from my cloak. "Keep laughing and I’ll cram you in a bottle and trade you to a shop for a wooden shield. At least that way I’d get </span>
      <span class="c4">some</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> peace, </span>
      <span class="c4">and </span>
      <span class="c0">a more useful companion."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl clutched her chest as if mortally wounded. "Oof! Low blow! And here I thought we were bonding. Come on, admit it—this sleek new bod's getting you into places old you never could!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"I’d trade every 'advantage' for my real body back," I muttered, adjusting my damp tunic. I crossed my arms over my chest, fingers unintentionally pressing into the soft curves I still hadn’t gotten used to. The sensation made my stomach twist. "I’d rather not have </span>
      <span class="c4">these</span>
      <span class="c0">, thank you very much. Besides..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I sighed and dropped my hands. "If I still had my original form, I could've just walked through the damn front gate."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Ughhh, fine, whatever..." Tatl huffed, flipping in midair. "You're </span>
      <span class="c4">such</span>
      <span class="c0"> a buzzkill sometimes. Just trying to lighten the mood! This place could be worse."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"And </span>
      <span class="c4">you’re</span>
      <span class="c0"> welcome to stay down here in this...ugh...smelly sewer if you love it so much," I snapped back, trudging after her. My voice echoed off the tunnel walls—high-pitched, strained, unfamiliar. It mocked me like some other version of myself had stolen my place.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Without warning, the earth shuddered beneath my feet. I staggered, catching myself against the slick stone as another tremor groaned through the ground. The walls moaned around me, the vibrations crawling through my bones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As the rumbling faded, I let out a shaky breath I hadn’t realized I’d been holding.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Link! This isn’t a spa day! Save the beauty rest for after we stop the moon!" Tatl barked from ahead, her glow flickering like an impatient candle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c4">I swear I'm going to pull her wings off...</span>
      <span class="c0"> I thought darkly, scowling as I resumed my squelching march down the sewer path.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">I plodded on for a few more meters, stopping at the edge of a waterway. The narrow canal spilled over into a deeper basin, its surface reflecting the flickering light of a torch perched atop a cubic stone island rising from the center of the fetid pool. The air was thick with the stench of stagnant water and mildew. Though the torch looked deceptively close, the jump required to reach it seemed longer than any I’d attempted before. Tatl hovered above the stone platform, her wings casting tiny ripples of light on the surrounding walls.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"C'mon! Just hop across, it's not that far!" Tatl called, her glow dancing in encouragement.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c4">Well, I've come all this way,</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> I told myself. </span>
      <span class="c4 c12">I can't turn back now!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I backed up a few paces, took a deep breath, and broke into a run. I leapt from the edge, feeling an unexpected surge of grace and lightness in my stride—perhaps a strange benefit of my newly changed form. I soared further than I’d ever thought possible, landing on the stone block with a jarring thump. The impact made my chest bounce painfully, drawing a startled grunt from my lips, but I managed to stay upright. I turned and looked back in awe. That had definitely been the furthest leap I’d ever made.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Nice job! For once you're actually light on your feet!" Tatl praised with a chuckle. "Think you can make it to the other side?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She gestured toward the far end of the waterway. Beyond the dark ripples, the tunnel resumed—grey stone walls and a low ceiling funneling toward a sharp turn. Another torch flickered at the bend, its dim glow casting spidery shadows across the floor. I nodded, shaking out my shoulders.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah, I think I’ve got one more in me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"OK, I’ll go on ahead and wait for you," Tatl chimed, zipping through the dank air and disappearing toward the next landing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">Tatl paused beside the flickering torchlight, hovering just above the ledge to ensure I'd landed safely. I took a deep breath, wanting to show off a bit, and sprinted toward the gap. Launching from the island ledge with a burst of energy, I tucked into a forward flip midair—twisting through the gloom like a ribbon on the wind. My soft deer hide boots struck the stone floor with a muted thud near the water’s edge, and I let out a breathless laugh of triumph.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Pfft... show off," Tatl muttered, though I caught the amused twinkle in her glow. "Let’s move on before you sprain something."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I rolled my eyes and waved her off with a half-smile, striding confidently down the corridor. The dark stone walls curved ahead, and faint glimmers of light began to flicker against them. The ambient torchlight caught on the subtle green folds of my traveling cloak, its soaked hem brushing the backs of my knees with each step. Beneath the cloak, my long brown tunic clung damply to my frame, its edge falling just past my thighs. My black tights were still damp and snug against my legs, their fabric streaked with a few smudges from the crawlspace. My soft deerskin boots, supple and silent, squelched faintly with every footfall. Damp air whispered through the tunnel and toyed with the cloying strands of my ponytail as I extended my gloved hands for balance, each step placed with cautious resolve.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We crept closer until another chamber emerged from the shadows. A large, rough-hewn square had been carved into the wall—clearly shaped by hand tools rather than magic. The warm light beyond spilled invitingly through the passage.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I eased forward and peered through the stone threshold.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Inside, the room glowed with a cozy, unexpected charm. Several large wooden crates lined the left wall, worn from age but still sturdy. Piles of old carpets and raggedy rugs lay scattered around, forming a lumpy nest of color in the center. Wooden toys, half-broken but lovingly repaired, sat beside a handful of dog-eared books. A cluster of torches bathed the chamber in golden light, their flames casting playful shadows across the walls—each one covered in vibrant finger-paint drawings. Suns, stars, and strange animals danced across the stone in swirls of blue, red, and green. At the far end, a wooden ladder rose toward another hallway, its rungs polished by many small hands climbing again and again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">I moved into the room some paces, but stopped when I heard a burst of loud snoring. I quickly signaled for Tatl to do the same, and began looking side to side in order to locate the source. I noticed four boys, of various ages, sleeping among the rug and blanket piles. The snoring was coming from a plump kid wearing a blue outfit. He was rolled over on his belly, and had the number "five" stitched to the back of his shirt. This must have been the Bomber's hideout!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">Carefully, I stepped between scattered piles of blankets and half-eaten snacks, my every movement deliberate. I doubted the Bombers would appreciate a so-called girl discovering their sacred sanctuary, and waking them up might have led to chaos. Thankfully, the soft, supple leather of my new deerskin boots muted my steps. They hugged just beneath my knees, the flexible hide offering both warmth and silence—far better than the clunky pair I’d worn before. Those would've given me away in an instant.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">Each footfall was painstakingly measured, the dim lantern light flickering across the sleeping forms like a warning. My brown tunic brushed quietly against my black tights with every step, and my green cloak swayed gently behind me. Fingerless gloves gripped the bow slung across my shoulder, and for a brief moment, I almost felt like myself again—except for the telltale shift in my center of balance and the weight now subtly distributed across my frame.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">At last, I reached the ladder nestled in the far wall. Tatl was already hovering above it, her soft glow casting faint shadows on the rungs. I climbed steadily upward, the ladder's wood cool and slightly damp beneath my fingers. The hush behind me remained unbroken—only the soft, rhythmic snoring of the sleeping Bombers whispered up from below. At the top, I allowed myself a quiet breath of relief and stole one last glance downward. The boys were still deeply asleep, untouched by our quiet intrusion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We pressed forward.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The passage opened into a chamber that felt like a forgotten observatory dreamt into stone. Warm golden light from flickering sconces pooled in the corners, glinting off burnished brass instruments and dust-flecked glass. Tables brimmed with beakers of glittering, colored solutions and thin-necked flasks that pulsed with internal light. Delicate copper wires curled between vials and glass orbs, while intricate metal tools lay scattered like alchemical relics awaiting their forgotten purpose. It smelled faintly of old ink, lavender, and something bright and metallic—like the memory of starlight caught in glass.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Books were stacked not only on shelves, but also in organized towers on the floor, their leather spines creased with age. One bookshelf sagged under the weight of ancient tomes and coiled scrolls tied with twine, their paper yellowed and curling. Nearby, a well-worn recliner rested by a brass reading lamp, a folded quilt draped over one arm as if awaiting the return of a scholar long in retreat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">To the right, a spiral staircase emerged from the stone floor—made of sun-faded wood dyed a mottled blue, its railings carved with swirling constellations and crescents. It curled upward into shadow, a beckoning ribbon that shimmered with mystery.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">"Uhhh... hey Link," Tatl murmured, slowing in the air. "You should go on without me. I think I'm gonna stay down here..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What?... Why?" I paused, foot hovering over the first step. Tatl's glow dimmed, her wings twitching with unease as a look of guilt twisted across her tiny features.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Umm... Well, back when I was with the Skull Kid, we... </span>
      <span class="c4">might</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> have gotten into some trouble with the astronomer. Messed with his gear a little. And he </span>
      <span class="c4">might</span>
      <span class="c0"> have tried to set us on fire. Look, it's complicated, and I'd really rather not talk about it. Just... go. I’ll wait here."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I blinked in disbelief. "He </span>
      <span class="c4">tried to set you on fire</span>
      <span class="c0">?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl shrugged, trying to act casual but failing miserably. "It was more of a... strategic use of a blowtorch. Anyway, bygones!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Despite myself, I let out a short huff of laughter. It cut through the anxiety, just a little. I looked at her more kindly, the corner of my mouth twitching up. "You'll be okay. Just don’t touch anything this time, pyromancer."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl flickered nervously again, wings buzzing. "Right! Just stay calm, don't break anything, and you’ll be fine! Probably. And hey—if he tries to roast you, remember: duck and cover."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I groaned, but the banter soothed something knotted inside me. I placed a hand on the railing, a reluctant smile tugging at my lips. The thought of dealing with an eccentric old man wasn’t appealing—especially one who may or may not have weaponized a blowtorch—but I’d come too far to hesitate now. One step at a time, I ascended the staircase, my boots echoing softly against the worn wood, each step lit with scattered hues of refracted starlight.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">At the top, I stepped into a vast circular chamber that felt like crossing a threshold into myth. The Star Chamber. Above me, images of stars and moons swirled across the curved indigo ceiling—projected from a massive, cylindrical scope mounted on a raised platform in the center of the room. The scope stretched upward, disappearing through the open roof like a pipe organ of the cosmos, reaching for the stars it sought to understand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The walls were lined with diagrams and sketches of constellations, planetary cycles, and celestial mechanics, all scribbled over in a spidery, near-illegible scrawl. Charts fluttered slightly from the drafts in the room, catching the soft light with every movement.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I let out a breath. There, just to the side, was a door leading out to fresh air. My shoulders relaxed just a touch. No more tunnels, not today. Thank the goddesses.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I shook the exhaustion from my limbs and stepped further into the room. I was too close now to back down. Somewhere in here, I’d find the help I desperately needed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">In the center of the raised platform, directly beneath the towering telescope, stood an old man draped in flowing blue robes that shimmered faintly like starlight. His white beard cascaded down to his chest in wisps, and a pair of round spectacles perched precariously on his nose. Behind him, scrolls and parchment were scattered across a side table, as though he lived entirely among the stars.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c4">That must be the astronomer,</span>
      <span class="c0"> I thought, and approached with caution, noting the way his long fingers nimbly adjusted a dial on the telescope.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The elderly man remained hunched over the scope, brow furrowed in intense concentration. I stepped carefully onto the platform, trying not to startle him. Still, the wooden floor gave a faint creak under my weight. He turned with a soft grunt, eyes twinkling beneath his lenses as he finally noticed me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh! Hello there, young lady!" he greeted with theatrical flair, his voice echoing slightly beneath the domed ceiling. "Such a rare delight to receive visitors in these days of uneasy stars. My name is Reton, humble observer of the heavens and caretaker of this observatory. And who might you be, starborn wanderer? The Bombers rarely send strangers through their secret way... are you one of their trusted allies?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Uhhhh...hi…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I replied awkwardly, my stomach twisting at the greeting. 'Young lady' again. No matter how many times I heard it, it still hit like a slap—like an echo of something I wasn’t ready to accept. I tried to swallow the discomfort, plastering on a faint smile. Best not to raise any red flags.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Um... the Great Fairy sent me. She said the moon would guide the way?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Mmm... the Great Fairy, you say?" Reton stroked his beard, his eyes gleaming with a flicker of curiosity. "Then surely this is no ordinary errand. Very well, let us see what the heavens reveal."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He turned back to the towering mechanism with a fond reverence, adjusting the intricate array of brass knobs and ivory-inlaid dials. Each click echoed like the ticking of a cosmic clock in the hushed observatory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"There we go," he murmured with satisfaction. "Come, child, look through this telescope and see what the skies would have you know."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I stepped up to the massive lens... or</span>
      <span class="c4"> telescope</span>
      <span class="c0"> as he called it, and leaned forward, one hand steadying myself against the polished wood casing. The metal eyepiece was cool against my skin. The surface of the moon loomed close in the frame, cratered and brooding, its furious face looming like a cosmic horror. No sign of the Skull Kid—yet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"How do I move it?" I asked, trying to keep my voice even, though the sheer craftsmanship of the instrument made me nervous to touch it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ah yes, yes—of course," Reton said, gesturing with a knobby hand that trembled slightly with age. "This dial will guide you left and right, and those smaller ones—zoom. Treat her gently, as you would a skittish steed or a cherished harp. She's a bit cranky, but she can dance if you know how to lead her."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I nodded and began to adjust the view. The image shifted as I panned outward, revealing more of the town and the rolling horizon beyond. The sun now blazed high and golden, casting stark shadows that stretched like fingers across the cobbled streets. I realized with a jolt that it must be nearing noon—the crawl through the tunnels had stolen more time than I’d thought.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Clock Town sparkled below me like a freshly polished gem. Wet rooftops glinted as if lacquered in gold, and puddles in the alleys gleamed like shattered bits of glass. Banners snapped crisply in the breeze, their colors bright against freshly scrubbed stone. Flower boxes brimmed with renewed life, their petals unfurling as if the storm had kissed them awake. Chimneys puffed lazy curls of smoke, and the rooftops shimmered with the rain’s last sighs. The town looked reborn, yet beneath the sparkle was a tension I could feel in my bones—a peace too delicate to last.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I adjusted the telescope and swept it slowly over the town’s perimeter, tracing the walls before shifting to the wild world beyond. Towering snow-draped mountains loomed behind the town, rising like frozen sentinels. Their jagged peaks kissed the clouds, stark against the blue-washed horizon. To the west, a great sea shimmered like molten silver, its waves lapping endlessly against some distant unseen shore. To the east, ochre-colored desert canyons sprawled across the land like cracks in a sun-scorched map. Below the telescope’s reach, thick trees stood like silent sentinels, ringing a barren stretch of deforested flatlands that encircled the town like a forbidden wall of green, veiling whatever moved beneath their canopy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Despite the clarity, I found no sign of the masked Skull Kid. Nothing but the endless world and the impossible weight of uncertainty. I thought back to what Tatl had said—the Skull Kid could travel between realms. If that was true... was he even in this world anymore? The question hung in my chest like stone. I sighed and stepped back from the lens.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The astronomer must have heard me and turned, concern etched in his wrinkled features.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"My dear, what's the matter? Did you not find what you were looking for?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No," I said softly, feeling the weight of failure settle on my shoulders. "I couldn't find anything."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well, what might you be looking for? Perhaps I could be of some assistance?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I hesitated, uncertain. But the Great Fairy trusted this man. If she believed in him, maybe I could too. I swallowed and decided to take the risk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'm looking for a masked skull kid. He stole something very precious from me, and I have to get it back."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Reton stiffened. "Wait... Skull Kid? You mean </span>
      <span class="c4">the</span>
      <span class="c0"> Skull Kid—the one who's been wreaking havoc across Termina? The one who nearly destroyed my laboratory?!" His voice bristled with sudden outrage, his hands clenched at his sides.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah, I think so," I replied cautiously. "Do you think you know where he is?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Reton stroked his long, wiry beard and hummed, a deep furrow forming between his brows. Then, suddenly, his eyes brightened with inspiration.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, but I might have a theory. Have you noticed how the moon seems to be glaring down at a specific point?" The elder shuffled toward the telescope.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stepped aside, allowing him access to the lens. "No, not really. I hadn’t even considered it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Neither had I—until recently," he said, adjusting the telescope with quick, practiced movements. "That dreadful imp has stumbled across something of immense power. He’s been using it to sow chaos across the realm. What if he’s also using it to control the moon? And if that’s true... then maybe the moon’s gaze itself is a clue."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He rotated the dials and adjusted the zoom, the soft clicks of the apparatus punctuating the tension in the room. Suddenly, Reton let out a sharp, triumphant bark of laughter and stepped back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ah-ha! I believe I’ve found his hiding place!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I darted forward and pressed my eye to the lens. The red glow of the moon’s furious gaze filled my view, and as Reton nudged the telescope to follow its line of sight, the lens came to rest squarely on the top of the town’s ancient clock tower.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"There he is!" I gasped, breath catching with a strange mixture of excitement and dread. "The Skull Kid—he’s on top of the clock tower!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Indeed he is, child." Reton's bushy eyebrows rose in concern. "But what are you going to do? You should be fleeing! That moon will likely fall tomorrow morning, and you must escape to a place far from here!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"I can't run from this. I… I need to stop him." I stepped back from the telescope, my hands clenched at my sides. "It's the only chance I have to get my life back to normal. Why don't </span>
      <span class="c4">you</span>
      <span class="c0"> run?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The old man gave a soft, wistful smile. "My life is almost at an end anyway, my dear girl. I'd rather die watching a beautiful, cosmic show of destruction than gasping for a last breath of air on my deathbed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stared at him for a moment, surprised by the serenity in his voice. Then I nodded. I understood. If I was going to die, I, too, would rather go out in a blaze of glory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">But unlike him, I wasn’t ready to give up yet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I turned away, making for the edge of the platform. Behind me, Reton’s voice rang out with a sudden urgency.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"If that wretched imp has the power to bring down the moon, what hope do you have of beating him, my dear?" he pleaded. "You wouldn’t stand a chance—even with that magnificent bow slung on your back!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I paused, one foot already lifted to leap from the platform, and glanced back over my shoulder. I gripped the bow on my back instinctively, as if drawing strength from its presence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Even if I don’t succeed," I said quietly, my voice low but steady, "I have to at least try. Because if I do nothing, I’ll lose </span>
      <span class="c4">everything</span>
      <span class="c0">. And I’ve already lost too much."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">A flicker of heat tightened in my throat—half grief, half defiance. For days now, I'd been changing, unraveling, and fighting to hold onto something that still felt like </span>
      <span class="c4">me</span>
      <span class="c0">. But now, for the first time, the path forward didn’t feel like surrender. It felt like a battle worth fighting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">The elderly man chuckled, a warm sound tinged with admiration. "Well... I must admit. You have far more courage within </span>
      <span class="c4">you</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> than most of the denizens of Termina </span>
      <span class="c4">combined</span>
      <span class="c0">. I wish you the best of luck, child."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I offered him a faint, grateful smile, then turned and descended the winding stairs—now armed with the most important thing of all: not just resolve, but a burning need to reclaim my fate, to right the wrongs Skull Kid has brought on this world before it was too late.</span>

    </h1>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I reached the bottom of the stairwell to see Tatl entertaining herself by flipping through some open picture books. Relief shone through her features when she saw I was unharmed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"See? You're ok! Although... honestly I admit that I didn't know if the astronomer had been affected by Skull Kid's magic, but there was nothing to worry about after all!" Tatl twinkled. "Soooo... did you find where the Skull Kid is hiding?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, well thanks for that!" I sarcastically replied. "And yeah I did. He's controlling the moon from the top of the Clock Tower in town."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl huffed in frustration and kicked the book she had been studying shut, a soft thud echoing throughout the small room. "Of course he is! Why didn't I think of that?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I looked at the pixie in confusion. "What do you mean? Are you saying that we could have skipped this whole mess of a journey? I crawled through a sewer to get here!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Look, I wasn't thinking straight, I'm sorry! I don't like to ruminate about stuff like that, ok!?" Tatl snapped back, but there was a flicker of pain behind her words, like a flame shrinking inward.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What do you mean? Stuff like what?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I just...!" Tatl paused and softened her voice. "I just don't like to think about the past. That junk simply distracts from the present..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We stood in silence. The flickering torchlight painted long shadows across the walls, and for a moment, it felt like the room was holding its breath with us. I understood her hesitation. The past was a wound I carried too—one that had never quite closed. Horrific struggles, torn friendships, betrayals that still echoed in my chest. A different world. A different me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I know what you mean," I said, voice quieter now. "The past is also hard for me to talk about… It hasn't been an easy life for me, even before all of this nonsense."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I knelt beside her, folding my legs underneath me, and looked up into her glowing form, haloed in the soft, golden light from the bookshelves nearby. "But if you ever </span>
      <span class="c4">do</span>
      <span class="c0"> want to talk about it, I'm here. You don’t have to carry all that alone. Not anymore."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl hovered there for a long moment, her wings beating slowly, the quiet hum sounding almost like a heartbeat in the stillness. Then, with hesitant grace, she drifted forward and gently rested herself against my shoulder. Her glow softened, no longer sharp and flickering, but calm—like a firelight remembering how to be warm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Same goes for you, dummy," she murmured. Her voice was quieter than I'd ever heard it. "You don’t have to keep pretending you're made of stone. I see you. You know... even when you try to hide it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Something in her words broke through the last of my armor. I let out a small breath, one I hadn’t realized I was holding, and closed my eyes for a moment. A fragile understanding passed between us—not made of grand declarations, but of quiet, mutual scars that hummed in the spaces we dared not speak aloud.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The world outside was ending. The sky was falling. But in that moment, a thread was woven between two broken souls. Not because I was stronger. But because, for once, I wasn’t entirely alone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I guess... you deserve to know about it. In a way, a small part pertains to you as well..." Tatl whispered, still resting lightly on my shoulder. She took a breath that shimmered with the weight of memory, and began:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Before all the bad stuff happened, Tael, Skull Kid, and I were kind of a family. We stuck together because no one else would take us in. We were outcasts, and orphans." Tatl sighed. "On clear evenings, Tael and I would carry Skull Kid up the Clock Tower and watch the sunset over the ocean. We would all laugh, tell jokes, talk about our desires, and just have fun. When night fell, we gazed at the blanket of stars shining with the moon. I'd recite old legends and ghost stories, and we'd be up all night, too terrified or excited to sleep." Tatl paused, her glow dimming slightly with the ache of remembrance. "Those were during the good times..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Sounds to me like you were really attached to Skull Kid... what happened?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl fell quiet, her wings twitching faintly. When she finally spoke, her voice was tinged with bitterness and grief. "That stupid mask happened. As soon as Skull Kid put it on... he changed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She fiddled with her tiny hands, the motion a shield against the storm she was reliving.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Skull Kid, well, he was always kinda mischievous. He loved to play pranks on others, but his jokes rarely ever hurt people. One day, we were playing hide and seek in the forest and we were having a great time! Skull Kid was the seeker, Tael and I hid in the bushes a ways away. We'd been waiting for him for a while, when suddenly Skull Kid started calling out to us, saying that he wanted to show us something. When we reached him, we saw a man with a large pack lying unconscious in the grass. There were masks of all shapes and sizes everywhere, and there was Skull Kid, standing over the man's body... and wearing that awful horned, purple mask."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl turned to face the wall, her small body trembling. Her voice had grown thinner, and something in her shimmered like the last leaf on a tree.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"His pranks quickly became more and more violent, and he forced us to participate. Innocent bystanders suffered. We trashed towns and homes. People started to hate us. But despite all that, Tael and I stayed with him, really hoping that he would see the pain he caused and would stop. But he only grew worse the longer he wore the mask."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl sniffled, and faced me again. Her tiny eyes were still glazed over in memory, and in them I saw something raw and unhealed—the heartbreak of watching someone you love disappear inside themselves.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"It wasn't much longer before the guardian deities of this land banded together, and kicked us out of Termina. That's when he changed for the worst," she said softly, her voice laced with a sorrowful kind of reverence. "Skull Kid was filled with a terrible wrath, screaming about revenge, and how everyone would pay. His dark mask began to give him strange abilities, at the cost of his good spirit. He went through the forest we were sent to, and focused his anger and rage on every living being he came across. In his eyes, they were all his own personal playthings..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Her words hung between us like a bitter mist. The torchlight shimmered faintly in the corners of her glow, and for once, there was no sarcasm, no mockery. Only grief.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl broke her focus and turned to meet my gaze. Her wings gave the faintest flick, not out of impatience, but to keep herself grounded in the moment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"And that's when we met you. The Skull Kid saw you and your horse moving through the woods and thought it would be fun to mess with a swordsman. We followed, and... well, you know the rest..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She floated closer, so close I could feel the warmth of her light on my cheek. "Link... I'm sorry for my part. I truly didn't think it would ever go so far..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Her voice cracked just slightly. Not from guilt, but from the quiet ache of someone finally laying down a burden they'd carried too long. It was the first time I had ever heard such sincerity come from her. I was speechless, a tightness blooming in my chest, but I nodded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"It's ok, Tatl. Thank you. Thank you for telling me all of that. It couldn't have been easy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"But you understand, right?" she pleaded, drifting back an inch. "The Skull Kid isn't really evil. I'm positive that it's the mask that's causing him to be this way! We have to help him!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I looked away. The room suddenly felt colder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I don't know... All I can be certain of is that he's going to destroy the world, and I have to stop him. It might not even be possible to help him. I'm sorry."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl nodded, but there was something hollow in the gesture. Like part of her had braced for those words, and still hoped she wouldn’t hear them. She hovered silently for a moment longer, then turned abruptly and zipped toward the passageway leading back through the sewer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well... either way. We can't do anything while we stand around here. We have to get back to town, and to the top of that tower!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Wait, why can't we just go the normal way back into town?" I asked, tilting my head. "There's a door leading right outside, up there!" I pointed up the stairs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well yeah... but... I don't want to be spotted by that crazy old man. He could snap at the first sight of me, and then incinerate us with his horrible fire spitting blowtorch!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I waved her off with a sigh. "He's not crazy. You guys broke his stuff. I'd be angry too! And besides, the Bomber kids down there are probably awake by now. I really don't feel like explaining myself to them. Now, let's hurry outside and head back to town!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I turned and started up the stairs, the conversation still clinging to my thoughts like morning mist. Behind me, I heard Tatl grumble under her breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Urghh... fine, Miss Prissy. I'll just hide under your cloak until we're back in town."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She zipped underneath the folds of my green cloak, her deep vulnerability shuttered behind sarcasm once more. But I felt the warmth of her light settle at my shoulder, quieter than usual. And I understood.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Some things are too raw to hold in the open air for long.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I slowed as we neared the top of the stairwell and peeked around the corner to the rising platform. Reton was completely focused on his telescope, muttering quietly to himself as his robes gently rustled in the breeze from the open hatch above. I tiptoed toward the door, the wooden floorboards creaking faintly beneath my soft boots. With careful fingers, I eased the latch open and slipped outside.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I squinted against the brilliant afternoon light, my eyes watering as they adjusted after so long in the subterranean gloom. The Star Chamber crowned the peak of a low hill, encircled by tall trees whose canopies murmured with the wind. Gusts tousled my hair and swirled around my green cloak, which still shielded Tatl, grumbling, beneath its fur-lined interior. The breeze smelled of pine and damp earth, tinged faintly with the scent of something floral just beginning to bloom. Below me, the white limestone walls of Clock Town stood tall and quiet, their rough-hewn faces gleaming under the early summer sun. From here, the town looked peaceful—a gem set against the backdrop of an approaching doom.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The Clock Tower loomed in the distance, its long shadow casting a solemn swath over the town’s rooftops. Its four-sided clock face glinted quietly in the sun, unmoving, as if holding its breath. I could almost hear the echo of a bell that hadn’t yet rung. It was now one o'clock.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">After taking a moment to breathe in the eerie calm, I gauged the hill's slope. It wasn't too steep, and the grassy incline beckoned like an open invitation. With a running start, I vaulted forward, cloak streaming behind me. The hill was soft beneath my boots, each step muffled by thick blades of grass as I picked up speed. Tatl let out an indignant squeak as she was jostled about in the folds of my cloak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Oof! Could you </span>
      <span class="c4">not</span>
      <span class="c0"> treat me like a sack of beans?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I laughed, my hair whipping around me as the wind rushed past. The air tasted clean and wild, and for a brief moment, I felt free.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">With a final leap, I landed at the base of the hill among a cluster of maple and birch trees. Shadows clung to their trunks in broad, broken shapes. The rustle of leaves was joined by the chirp of unseen birds, and the distant hum of insects waking from the storm's aftermath. I took a few steadying breaths, then noticed the dirt path curving gently upward—a trail I had entirely missed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What were you thinking? I'm stuck in your hot, stinky cloak, having a bad time, and you go jumping off cliffs when we have a perfectly good trail to walk down?" Tatl's muffled voice shot from the folds of fabric, furious and faintly wheezy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh stop whining, that way was faster." I smirked. "Besides, with all your little jokes about me lately, you had it coming. Why are you still in there anyway?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well... I... but..." Tatl sputtered, clearly struggling to defend her cowardice. "Pshh! Whatever... I don't want that dumb old man to see me, who knows what else he has in his arsenal."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I chuckled and stepped onto the dirt path, brushing my hands along the wild grass lining its edge. The trees thinned out as we walked, the ground beneath my boots shifting between packed soil and slick patches of mud. Overhead, the leafy canopy became dense again, blotting out the sun and casting the grove into a cool twilight hush. Mottled pools of light danced between the leaves, catching on dewdrops and spiderwebs stretched between the branches.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The quagmire made the hike back to town a sluggish plod. My deerskin boots were great for stealth and acrobatics, but terrible for trudging through rough terrain. My feet were sucked into the clinging mud with each step, and the dirt path blended in with the bog. The slop forced me to fight to stay balanced and upright, and each pull flung the thick muck every which way. I must have looked like a street urchin, crawling through untold filth from the sewer and now this thick mud. Maybe I could get cleaned up at the Stock Pot Inn if there was time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I reached the edge of the shaded grove, winded. Finally, on sundried dirt and fields, I decided to rest. I felt Tatl bat my cloak away, and free herself from the no doubt, foul-smelling garment. The pixie gulped deep breaths of fresh air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>"Do you </span>
      <span class="c8">gasp</span>
      <span class="c3"> have any idea how bad it stinks in there!?" Tatl wheezed dramatically, fanning her face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"There's nothing I can do about it. That's just what happens when you crawl through a sewer," I muttered, flicking splatters of mud off my leather gloves. The sunlight felt like a blessing, warming the chill from my bones as I kicked clumps of muck from my boots.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Link! Watch out!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>Something deep green flashed in the corner of my eye, and I twisted aside on instinct. A wet, slapping </span>
      <span class="c8">plop</span>
      <span class="c3"> struck the ground where I had just been. I turned, unslinging my bow in one smooth motion, and aimed at the threat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">What stood before me was a man-sized glob of animate slime. Its translucent emerald form rippled with inner motion, like thick syrup barely holding shape. Two bulbous eyes jiggled at the top of its dripping mass, and inside its gelatinous body, I glimpsed the half-digested remains of some unfortunate forest rabbit. The creature pulsed forward in a twitching lurch, shaped like a grotesque teardrop made of toxic jelly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>I blinked in disbelief. "What </span>
      <span class="c8">is</span>
      <span class="c3"> that thing?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl zipped up beside me, her wings buzzing in alarm. "That's a Chuchu! Normally they're small and harmless, but lately? Everything’s going wild. These things have multiplied and grown to absurd sizes. This one’s probably been feeding off magical runoff near town."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The Chuchu quivered and lurched again, its body wobbling like a drum of acid-filled pudding.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Great," I muttered, drawing my bowstring tight. "So what, do I just shoot it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"If you want to survive, yes!" Tatl snapped. "Don’t let it touch you! That slime is super acidic while it's alive. You'll roast faster than a Deku nut in a bonfire. Wait until it's down, then back off—it turns inert when it dies."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I narrowed my eyes. "Perfect. Just the relaxing stroll I needed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The Chuchu wobbled and leapt towards me once more, making sloppy splat sounds that echoed through the clearing like wet applause. I took aim with the magic bow, drew the string back—still amazed at the radiant shaft of white light that shimmered into existence—and let the bolt fly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c4 c12">FWAAASPLOOSH!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The creature let out a grotesque gurgle as the bolt pierced through its center, erupting into a spray of fluorescent goop. It collapsed into a glistening puddle of green sludge, twitching once before going still.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Wow... I </span>
      <span class="c4">love</span>
      <span class="c0"> this thing!" I held up the bow with a grin, turning to Tatl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She bobbed approvingly. "I'd say the Great Fairy knew exactly what she was doing. I mean, sure, Chuchus and balloons are hardly intimidating, but you’ve got real form. That shot was clean. Like you’ve been doing it for years."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I re-slung the weapon with a sense of practiced comfort. "Yeah, back in Hyrule I had a bow from a temple. It was elegant, powerful... one of my favorite weapons. I used it so much, it became instinct....like breathing or swinging a sword. Before I left, I gave it to my sworn brother Darunia and the Gorons as a parting gift."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Gorons? You mean you have those rock-eating dummies where you're from too?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I raised an eyebrow at her tone. "They're not dummies. Just... incredibly stubborn. But yeah, we had them too. I didn’t know there were Gorons in Termina."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Sure are," Tatl replied. "They live up north in the Snowhead mountains. I haven't been up there in a long time though, they're such a pain to traverse if you aren't made of stone."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As we neared the outskirts of town, I let that revelation roll around in my head. Could it be that Termina was some kind of mirror world? Had refugees from Hyrule crossed into this realm ages ago?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My thoughts were interrupted as the rattle of wheels and hooves clattered toward me from the dirt road. A rickety, horse-drawn cart came barreling down the path, its wheels squeaking in protest. The driver pulled hard on the reins with a shout, and the horses whinnied to a stop, kicking up a cloud of dust.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hooo, easy now!" the man bellowed, his deep voice like gravel tumbling in a barrel. "Hey! Young lady! Over here!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I tensed slightly and walked the short distance to the cart, hand near my belt in case things turned sideways. The man who hopped down had tallow-colored hair slicked back with oil, a grin missing a few teeth, and a smell that suggested he hadn't bathed since the last lunar cycle. His patchy tan shirt had seen better decades, and his khaki trousers were more hole than fabric.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Where are you headed? You can't really be going back to town... right? Why, haven't you seen that the moon is falling right on top of it?" he asked, his voice cracking with the strain of fear. His eyes were wide, rimmed red with exhaustion and desperation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Behind him, the wagon bed was crowded with terrified families. A woman clutched a crying infant swaddled in a patchwork blanket. A boy, no older than ten, stared blankly at the sky while holding a wooden sword in trembling hands. Another man rocked back and forth, whispering a prayer under his breath. The smell of smoke drifted from the town beyond, sharp and acrid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl whispered to me, "What are you doing! We don't have time for this dummy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah, I... ummm... I have family there," I said quickly, eyes fixed on the cart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The man didn't seem to believe me, but panic overrode his skepticism. He frantically beckoned for me to climb in. "Maybe so, but you should come with us! It's dangerous to go alone! Especially for a skinny little thing such as yourself. There's monsters and bad people running around EVERYWHERE! The guards abandoned the gates! The mayor's mansion is burning!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No thank you," I said softly but firmly. "I really have to get back to town."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I turned back toward the looming walls of Clock Town. Over them, thick clouds of smoke billowed into the air like black flags. I could hear faint cries carried on the wind—calls for help, for mercy, for someone to stop the sky from falling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey, wait! Are you sure you don't want to come with us?" the man shouted after me, voice tinged with helplessness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah, I'm positive! I'm sorry, but I have to get going!" I called back, already breaking into a jog.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok... I wish you and your family luck! Farewell! Be safe!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I heard the poor man scramble back onto the cart. The driver cracked the reins, and the wagon groaned forward, disappearing down the muddy path like a funeral procession fleeing from the grave.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I guess people in town are panicking. We'd better hurry and get back!" I told Tatl, and without another word, broke into a sprint.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We made it to the southern town gates just as the sun bled into the horizon, painting the sky with streaks of crimson and gold. The massive limestone entrance loomed before us like a monument to a dying world. Time felt warped, disjointed—as though every tick of the clock hastened the moon's descent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We entered the southern district, the slums where I'd first found the lost fairy that fateful night. Now, that same place had turned into a vision of the apocalypse. No guards patrolled the entrance. Their posts were abandoned, shields discarded like broken promises. In the distance, screams tore through the smoke-choked air—anguished, terrified, desperate. The clang of stolen swords, the crackle of burning homes, and the panicked braying of overburdened livestock filled every breath with chaos.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Townsfolk of every class scrambled through the streets, brandishing weapons or fists, clawing over wagons, doors, even each other to find some escape. A pair of noblemen fought tooth and nail over a crumbling rickshaw, their fine coats stained with soot and blood. Children wailed from alleyways as flames devoured the wooden skeletons of their homes. Horses lay shattered and screaming in the streets, many already rotting, their flanks torn by panic or worse.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">And then, impossibly, Gorons. Enraged about </span>
      <span class="c4">something</span>
      <span class="c0">, they rampaged down the boulevards, smashing buildings with massive stone hammers, their roars shaking window panes. I saw one tear the awning from a bakery and hurl it into a nearby fountain with a guttural cry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hurry! Let's get to that Clock Tower!" Tatl cried, her voice almost lost in the din, zipping down the debris-strewn street like a trailing spark.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I sprinted after her, dodging overturned carts and sidestepping throngs of frantic citizens. I drew my bow, heart pounding, prepared for anything. My boots splashed through puddles that glistened with firelight, slick with ash and blood.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Above it all, the Clock Tower loomed like a final sentinel—monolithic, unmoved. The terrible, leering moon now filled nearly the entire sky, its cratered face swollen with fury, leering down at us like a cruel god.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I pushed myself harder, lungs burning, until we reached the great base of the tower.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">There, at the massive wooden doors, stood the mask salesman. He waved us toward him with urgency, his limbs swaying like a puppet cut free of its strings. His eyes were far too calm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You, my young hero, have certainly waited too long to return my mask!" he said, looking me over.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"It's not my fault, I've run into a few difficulties as you can clearly see!" I snapped, gesturing bitterly to my altered form.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yes... I can see." His voice was quieter now. "I can help return you to your true self, but you must regain that which was stolen. Only then can I help."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Right, you need your mask," Tatl said sharply.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Not only my mask, but that sacred instrument."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You mean my Ocarina?" I frowned. "How do you know about that? It's supposed to be a Royal Family secret."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Why, I make it my business to know, yes. As I stated before, information buys happiness, and happiness is what I sell, hohoho!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">There was something terribly wrong about him—a flicker in his movements, like reality couldn't fully decide where he belonged. Power rolled off him like perfume, sweet and poisonous. But I had no choice. He was the only thread I had left.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Now, hurry young hero! The longer you wait, the more these people will suffer." He pointed to the exit with unnerving enthusiasm. "Be quick, and have faith! You shall succeed!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I turned to the door, Tatl trailing behind me with nervous sparks crackling off her wings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I really don't like that guy, he gives me the creeps!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I agree," I muttered, brushing my muddy bangs from my eyes. "But we may not like him, and we may not trust him, but he's the only one who seems to know what’s really happening."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah... I guess so," Tatl said, glancing back toward the tower. "I just hope we're not making a huge mistake."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I tilted my head up toward the peak of the Clock Tower, where time itself seemed to freeze. There was no path, no staircase. Just stone, shadow, and the promise of collapse. The scaffolding left by the fleeing construction crew barely scraped a fraction of the height.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"So... how the hell am I supposed to get up there?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We searched frantically, weaving through a landscape of chaos as screams and thunderclaps echoed around the plaza. A sickening pressure twisted through my gut and mind—like the dark tendrils from before were slithering inside me, coiling tighter with each heartbeat. There were no visible stairs up the brick tower, no open doors, no ropes, no hope.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I circled the base of the Clock Tower, my boots splashing through puddles and crunching shattered glass. At the far end, I spotted a narrow ramp leading to a crumbling ledge, barely clinging to the wall about thirteen meters off the ground. I ran a trembling hand across my temple, caked in grime and sweat, my vision flickering with panic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok... how do I even get to the top?" I muttered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Umm... Well, I certainly can't carry you like I did with Skull Kid! You may be lighter than you were before, but I can't possibly take you all the way up without killing myself!" Tatl snapped, though even her sarcasm trembled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I let out a groan, half-laughing in despair. "Great. I'm going to die looking like </span>
      <span class="c4">this</span>
      <span class="c0">."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Why don't you ask around? I've </span>
      <span class="c4">seen</span>
      <span class="c0"> people up there during festivals. There has to be a way!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I glanced around. The plaza, once alive with laughter and music, was now a silent grave. Ash drifted through the air like snow. Cracked stalls and abandoned confetti told the story of a celebration that would never come. Tatl must have seen the flicker of hopelessness in my eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Maybe we should return to the Stock Pot Inn? Anju might know something. Besides..." She flitted close to my tunic and wrinkled her nose. "You </span>
      <span class="c4">really</span>
      <span class="c0"> need a bath. Badly."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"We don't have time for that, Tatl!" I barked, swatting her away. The twisting in my head was getting worse—not just nausea, but something deeper, like my thoughts were warping, reshaping themselves. "The moon is falling by the minute, and I’m starting to feel sick...."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"But look around! That ledge is the only way! Even if you </span>
      <span class="c4">could</span>
      <span class="c0"> reach it, you’d never get up there fast enough!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I clenched my jaw. "Fine... I guess you're right. Let's just go."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We reached the inn long after twilight gave way to night. The earth groaned beneath our feet in violent tremors, like the world itself was trying to shake us off. The air was thick with ash and panic, every breath laced with smoke and dread.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Clock Town had become a waking nightmare.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Fires danced along rooftops, their orange tongues licking at the heavens, casting flickering shadows over the cobbled streets. Market stalls lay in splinters, fruits and trinkets crushed underfoot. A child wailed from beneath a toppled cart, his cries barely audible over the cacophony. A stray dog limped past us, trailing blood and looking back over its shoulder as if begging someone to explain why the sky was falling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Shadows of looters darted through alleyways, some clutching sacks of stolen bread or jewelry, others just running with nowhere left to go. Fistfights broke out in front of shuttered doors as families clawed for space in already overflowing wagons. Desperate townsfolk clung to shattered homes, shouting the names of loved ones lost in the smoke. From the direction of the mayor’s hall, thick black smoke rose in columns. Somewhere nearby, a woman screamed, her voice breaking into sobs before vanishing beneath the roar of collapsing stone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And above it all, the moon had descended so far it now scraped the clouds—massive, luminous, a swollen leering god of stone. Its hateful gaze burned down upon the Tower, casting the world in a deepening crimson glow</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We threw open the inn's doors to find it transformed into a ruin. Shelves splintered, chandeliers shattered, paintings torn from the walls. The faint scent of smoke filtered from upstairs. In the wrecked kitchen, we found Anju collapsed on the floor, cradling a photograph to her chest, her sobs muffled by the cacophony outside. Shards of broken dishes glittered like teeth around her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She was startled at our approach. "Oh! Miss Link! W-what happened to you? Why are you still in town!?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I have unfinished business at the top of the Clock Tower," I said breathlessly. "Do you know how to get up there?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"The Tower opens at midnight for the Festival of Time," Anju whispered, her voice cracking. "It was supposed to begin tonight. But now... now it may all vanish before it begins."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl spun around me in a panic. "Midnight?! Link, it's almost midnight now!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I turned to run, but Anju's cry stopped me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Wait! Please! If you see this man—</span>
      <span class="c4">my</span>
      <span class="c0"> Kafei—tell him I’m waiting! Please!" She ran toward me, holding out the photograph with trembling hands.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I took the picture. A young man with striking blue hair, red eyes, and a sapphire pendant stared back. He looked regal, gentle, full of promise.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"He was supposed to marry me tonight... and he vanished three days ago. I... I can’t go on without him."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tears spilled through her fingers. Without thinking, I dropped to my knees and held her. "I’ll find him. I swear. Now stay safe!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Just then, the building shook with an ear-splitting roar. The walls cracked, a wooden beam splintered above us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"We have to go!" I grabbed Anju’s hand and bolted for the exit. We exploded through the doors just as the inn collapsed behind us in a storm of dust and flame.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"C’mon! We can't stay here!" Tatl cried as buildings crumbled and fire rained from splintering rooftops.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Anju tore her hand away. "GO! I have to stay! For Kafei!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I hesitated. Just long enough to nod.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Then I ran.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We raced toward the Tower, dodging falling beams, splitting earth, and gouts of flame as the heavens howled. Time had run out.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The end of the world had begun.</span>
    </p>

      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">End of the Beginning</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The fearsome wind screamed through the skies, shredding banners and sending debris flying like shrapnel. The earth convulsed with escalating fury, rupturing stone and shattering roads as the terrible lunar ceiling lowered by the minute. The crumbling city around me was a ghost of its former self—barren, broken, forsaken. All who could flee had already vanished, and those who remained were swallowed by the void. Gravity itself seemed unhinged, torn in a cosmic tug of war between the dying world and the monstrous moon, which now loomed so close its craters were visible in terrifying clarity. Chasms cracked open beneath abandoned homes, devouring entire sections of the town like a beast gnashing its teeth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stood with Tatl at the base of the massive Clock Tower, the very ground beneath us trembling like a dying heartbeat. From above, the bellowing tones of midnight thundered across the city, each chime sounding more like a funeral bell than a celebration. Somehow, impossibly, the monolithic clock stood unbroken—its ancient face staring defiantly into the eye of the apocalypse. Fireworks launched from its heights, desperate and bright, as if their flaring brilliance could push back the doom that crept ever closer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I heard the grinding of great gears behind the cacophony and bolted toward the sound. On the ledge Tatl and I had found earlier, a gaping entrance yawned open where once there was only stone. I sprinted up the ramp, wind clawing at my cloak, and threw myself through the doorway. Inside was a dust-caked elevator shaft, dimly lit and swaying with each quake. A single iron lever jutted from the left wall like a relic. I yanked it hard as a distant building groaned and collapsed in a plume of fire.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The doors creaked shut behind us, sealing out the chaos, and the elevator began to rise with a lurch. A wave of vertigo swept through me, amplified by the swirling sensation tightening in my skull. My breath came in ragged pulses. I felt dizzy, unstable, as if the world outside and the world inside me were both unraveling at once. My limbs felt too long, too light, as if I were being remade again mid-ascent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl hovered beside me, wings fluttering erratically. "Here we go, Link. This is it! All we have to do is get your instrument back, and it will all be over!" she said, but her voice trembled under the weight of uncertainty.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I nodded, rolling my shoulders and bending my legs, trying to center myself. My outfit was still smeared with grime from the morning's crawl through the sewers, but that didn’t matter now. All that mattered was reclaiming the Ocarina. Returning to normal. Escaping this strange, unfamiliar body. But a quiet dread gnawed at the back of my mind—what if there was no going back? What if this body, these curves, this voice, this frame... had already become part of me?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I didn’t know how I would survive the apocalypse, but I knew one thing for sure:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I didn’t want to die like this. And I sure as hell didn’t want to stay this way in the afterlife, if there even was one.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The elevator slowed, shuddering to a groaning halt. The doors yawned open, and I stepped out warily onto the wide, bowl-like platform. Wind whipped around me, screaming like the voices of the dead, but here at the tower’s peak, there was an eerie stillness—a hush before the end. Far above, the moon leered like a flaming god, pulsing with violent crimson light. Below, the world buckled and burned.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Skull Kid hovered several meters off the platform, his small body limp in the air like a puppet held aloft by strings of shadow. Darkness bled from the mask that clung to his face, oozing and writhing in waves that shimmered with malice. And there beside him—trembling, wings flickering weakly—was Tael.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Tael!" Tatl cried out, her voice cracking. "Get away from him!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Sis! You came back!" The purple fairy turned to us, relief bursting through his trembling glow. "You gotta help me! Skull Kid's not listening to reason! He's lost!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Slowly, Skull Kid turned to face us. The movement was unnatural—slow, deliberate, like a marionette yanked against its will. In one hand, he twirled my Ocarina, rolling it across his fingers with a cruel carelessness, as if it were no more than a polished pebble.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Well, well, well… Look who decided to show up! I figured you'd still be stuck in that cave I left you in. But no matter... I'm thrilled to see the spell worked! That’s a </span>
      <span class="c4">great</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> look for you, Mr. Big Shot. Or should I say… </span>
      <span class="c4">Miss</span>
      <span class="c0"> Big Shot! Heeheeheehee! Not so threatening now, are you, little girl?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">His laughter rang out across the basin like a blade drawn across glass—sharp, awful, triumphant. The platform beneath me trembled with every cackle, and sparks of energy hissed from the mask like venomous snakes. Rage surged through me, hot and steady. I wouldn’t let him humiliate me again. I reached for my bow...but Tatl darted in front of me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Skull Kid! LOOK at what you’re doing! Look around you! Everything’s falling apart! You need to STOP!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Who's gonna stop me, traitor?! You and your pretty new friend? Ha!" Skull Kid cracked into a fit of laughter again, but it was strained now—like something else was laughing through him, stretching his voice beyond what it was meant to carry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tael darted forward, wings quivering. He turned to the fractured horizon and cried out with all he had:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Swamp, Mountain, Ocean, Canyon! Those who are there, come here, to our hour of need! Please!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">His voice echoed across the burning sky. For a split second, it seemed like the wind itself paused to listen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">In a blur of dark light, Skull Kid lashed out, smacking Tael to the platform. The fairy bounced off the stone with a cry and lay still, wings dimmed and twitching faintly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Shut UP, stupid fairy!" he shrieked, eyes glowing too brightly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Tael!" Tatl wailed, flying to her brother's side. "Don’t you </span>
      <span class="c4">dare</span>
      <span class="c0"> hurt my brother, Skull Kid! That’s it. We are DONE being your friends!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Skull Kid paused. The mask pulsed once—deep, throbbing, like a heartbeat from within a grave—and then he gave a careless shrug. "Whatever. Like I care. You’ll all pay either way. </span>
      <span class="c4">Nothing</span>
      <span class="c0"> can stop me now!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">He turned his face skyward and raised his arms. The mask’s jagged heart-horns flared with purple light, and a shriek—inhuman, ancient, and impossibly loud—tore through the sky like the cry of a god in agony. From the mask erupted tendrils of writhing violet energy, screaming into the clouds. They struck the moon like a whip, and the moon </span>
      <span class="c4 c12">responded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">A deafening roar cracked the heavens. Flames burst across the moon’s surface like bleeding wounds. It started to </span>
      <span class="c4 c12">accelerate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Faster.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Closer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Downward.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Link! What do we do?!" Tatl shouted to be heard over the deafening howl of wind and collapsing stone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I reached behind me, heart hammering, and grabbed the Great Fairy's bow slung across my back. Drawing a glowing arrow, I took aim while Skull Kid cackled in triumph, his guard momentarily lowered. I loosed the magic bolt. It sliced through the air with a high-pitched hum and struck the back of his head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The arrow of light didn’t pierce him—the dark aura enveloping him rippled like a living thing and absorbed most of the force—but the impact was enough. He reeled, staggering in midair like a puppet with cut strings. With a startled grunt, he dropped my Ocarina.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The sacred instrument struck the stone platform with a ringing thud that echoed like a chime through the sky.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Good shot, Link!" Tatl cried. "He dropped your thingy! I'll distract him—go!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She zipped toward Skull Kid in a blur of defiant light, weaving around his slashing arms and tugging at his tattered cloak. He snarled and swiped, eyes blazing, utterly focused on the annoying glimmer in his face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I locked onto the Ocarina lying beneath him. My heart surged. That small, gleaming artifact held everything—my identity, my power, my path home.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I broke into a sprint, boots pounding the trembling stone. Just before reaching it, I dropped into a slide and scooped the Ocarina from the ground in one smooth motion. The second my fingers touched its sacred curves, a searing warmth shot up my arms—and the world shattered.</span>
    </p>

      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Time froze.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Light and memory surged around me, and suddenly I was no longer atop the Clock Tower. I stood in the Temple of Time. Moonlight filtered through high stained glass windows, and the air smelled of old stone and divinity. My body… was my old body. Stronger. Broader. Familiar.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Zelda stood beside me, serene and radiant, her golden hair cascading in soft waves. She held the Ocarina in both hands, her eyes solemn.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You must do what you feel you have to... but please, take this," she said gently.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I took the Ocarina from her. The moment it touched my hands, the temple pulsed with magic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Link, always remember this. As long as you hold this Ocarina, you hold Time itself within your hands."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She raised it to her lips. The first notes of the Song of Time filled the chamber—soft, mournful, eternal. The melody swelled and echoed through the sacred space, wrapping around me like a blessing, or a farewell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As the last note faded, Zelda lowered the instrument and looked at me one final time. Her expression was bittersweet—hopeful and heartbroken.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Always hold this song within your heart," she whispered, "and the goddesses will keep you safe from the ravages of Time."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The vision dimmed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And then the whiteness took me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I was back at the top of the Clock Tower, the lunar inferno still blazing through the sky like a comet of wrath, tearing the very air apart. The heavens were aflame, stained with crimson and orange as though the gods themselves had bled across the firmament. Thunderous cyclones of fire swept over the land, setting entire fields ablaze. Massive earthquakes cracked the crust of the earth, toppling towers and swallowing screaming souls. Somewhere beneath all of it, Tatl still danced desperately through the smoke, distracting Skull Kid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"What are you doing?! This is no time for daydreaming, Link!" Tatl cried as she dodged a blast of dark energy. "Surely there must be </span>
      <span class="c4">something</span>
      <span class="c0"> you can do?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh Goddess of Time, save us!" I heard Tael gasp, his tiny voice raw and trembling. He clung to his sister in one final, fragile embrace.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">My heart surged. The moment crystallized. I </span>
      <span class="c4">knew</span>
      <span class="c0"> what to do.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I raised Zelda's Ocarina to my lips, my hands trembling but sure. I closed my eyes. My breath steadied. The world raged around me, but I shut it out. My fingers moved on their own, gliding across the sacred instrument’s familiar surface. The Song of Time spilled from me like a river long dammed, its notes cutting through the thunder and flame like bells tolling from another world.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">With the final note, the Ocarina pulsed with blue light—gentle and defiant. The air bent. Time shuddered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The world fizzled, unmade at the edges. Everything stretched into streaks of golden light, drawn upward and inward. I felt myself dissolving into the current of time, my soul launched backward through memory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Images blurred past: the hollow forest where I'd first met Skull Kid, the plunge through the gaping tree trunk, faces swirling like reflections on water. I saw the curse envelop me, the twisted laughter, the metal door beneath the tower—</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Then silence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Then light.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I opened my eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Sunlight poured down upon me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stood again at the base of the Clock Tower. The Ocarina of Time dimmed in my hand, still warm from the song. Tatl hovered beside me, her glow bright but uneven, flickering with disbelief.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Wha…? What just happened?" she breathed. Her eyes darted to the familiar stonework around us. "Are we... back to that first day?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She zipped skyward and gasped at the blue dome above. The moon was high and distant again, no longer tearing through the sky like a blade.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"D-did you... just turn back time?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I was just as stunned. The world was </span>
      <span class="c4">whole</span>
      <span class="c0">. The cracked scaffolding was reduced to its earlier frame. The scent of smoke and blood was gone, replaced with fresh-cut wood and morning dew. Construction workers hammered rhythmically at half-finished platforms. Merchants chatted. Townspeople bustled. Guards patrolled, unaware of the apocalypse they narrowly escaped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I guess I did..." I murmured, then touched my throat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My voice was still high, unmistakably feminine. A flash of irritation passed through me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I looked down at myself. Still the same soft, rounded form. Still the same clothes Tatl had found. At least they were clean now, and the enchanted bow remained strapped to my back. But inside, nothing had reset.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl floated closer, inspecting me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"But... you're still a girl?" she whispered. "You were only </span>
      <span class="c4">just</span>
      <span class="c0"> beginning to change when we were here last... Were we not affected by the song like everything else?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I guess not," I said through clenched teeth, heat creeping into my cheeks. "Let's just find the mask salesman again. He said he could cure me if I got my stolen item back."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As if on cue, the heavy Clock Tower doors groaned open, their wooden frames creaking like ancient bones. The Happy Mask Salesman emerged, his wide, unsettling grin stretching across his face. He motioned with a frantic hand, his shadow long and twitching under the light.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Come, come! Quickly now!" he urged, his voice sharp with urgency.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I startled, heart still pounding from the temporal plunge. Swallowing my suspicion, I followed Tatl close behind. Inside, the din of Clock Town vanished like a dream fading at dawn. All that remained was the slow, rhythmic churn of gears overhead and the eerie hush of something ancient waiting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The salesman stopped in the middle of the circular chamber. His hands folded together with unsettling grace.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Well done, young hero! I'm </span>
      <span class="c4">so</span>
      <span class="c0"> very pleased. Now—did you manage to reacquaint yourself with your sacred item?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yes, but it was no easy task," I replied, still winded. I lifted the Ocarina with care, the blue sheen of its surface catching the dim light. "Here it is."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ahh, marvelous! Just as I hoped!" the man exclaimed, clapping once with a sound too sharp to feel real. "With this, yes, I can help restore what was broken. I can teach you to mend your spirit... and return you to your true form."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He gave a bow and twirled toward the far wall, his steps jerky and uncomfortably gleeful. Then, as if summoned by thought alone, a colossal pipe organ faded into view—its twisted brass pipes blooming from the wall like metallic vines.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Now, listen carefully," he said, sliding onto the bench with twitchy reverence. "This melody holds magic older than the mask. If played by one who </span>
      <span class="c4">believes</span>
      <span class="c0">, it heals not only the flesh... but the soul. The Song of Healing, it is called."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He pressed the keys. The first notes were low and hollow—then swelled into something haunting, aching, whole. The song rang out into the chamber, folding itself around me like memory. Each phrase seemed to reach through the bones of the tower and brush the edges of the world itself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">When the final chord faded, the salesman turned to me, eyes wide and waiting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I raised the Ocarina. My breath shook.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">With a steadying inhale, I played. The tune felt like it had always been within me, waiting to be remembered. The song poured out in smooth spirals, wrapping me in peace, as if the instrument and I were becoming one. The chamber pulsed. The shadows leaned in.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Then came the pain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">At first, it was no more than pressure behind my sternum. But it bloomed, rapidly—sharp, blooming fire. My limbs locked. My skin crawled. I gasped and crumpled, every nerve alight. It felt like I was being peeled away from myself, like layers were sloughing off beneath invisible hands. The Ocarina tumbled from my grip, ringing against the stone floor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I screamed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My bones shifted with wet, muffled pops.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I gasped... a sound caught somewhere between a moan and a sob. My spine compressed with a crackling pulse, hips wrenching outward with a jarring tug, as though I were being sculpted by some cruel artisan. I could </span>
      <span class="c4">feel</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> the flesh at my waist drawing inward, tightening around a frame that was no longer mine. Breasts swelled again—round, aching, undeniable—and this time there was no ambiguity. The sensation wasn’t just change; it was </span>
      <span class="c4">confirmation.</span>
      <span class="c0"> A terrifying solidifying of a direction I hadn’t chosen, carved into my very marrow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">My hands, still gloved, grasped blindly at the floor. They were too small, too light—fingers delicate and trembling like those of a porcelain doll. Every nerve pulsed with raw electricity. My tunic clung differently now—tight across my chest, snug around my hips. The shifting undergarments offered no comfort, their unfamiliar tug a constant reminder that the change had not merely returned—it had progressed</span>
      <span class="c4">.</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> Feminine in a way that felt impossibly </span>
      <span class="c4 c12">complete.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I whimpered. My voice broke high, bright, unmistakably sweet...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Then the light deepened. I arched against the pull of it, crying out again as something inside me—</span>
      <span class="c4">deep</span>
      <span class="c0"> inside—was drawn upward like thread through a needle. I felt it stretch, burn, and snap, replaced by an aching hollowness... or perhaps something new. A sharp, hard clatter struck the floor beside me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">When the radiance finally receded, I was curled on the Clock Tower floor, every breath a shallow flutter in my chest. The Song of Healing had done </span>
      <span class="c4">something</span>
      <span class="c0">—yes—but not what I had pleaded for. Not a restoration.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The hush that followed rang louder than the scream.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl hovered nearby, her wings twitching. "L-Link... are you okay?" Her voice was barely audible.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I opened my mouth. The words faltered in a voice that didn’t belong to me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Then came the Salesman. His hands folded in delight. His voice too pleased.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh my... this is most unexpected. Most unexpected indeed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">His smile did not reach his eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 936.00px;">

      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And in that moment, I realized: whatever I had become... it was no longer reversible by song alone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Tatl fluttered around me in slow, hesitant arcs, as if unsure whether she should speak or even </span>
      <span class="c4">touch</span>
      <span class="c0"> me. Her glow was dimmer than usual, flickering with uncertainty, like she too had been affected by the song's backlash.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You... you're not better," she whispered. "You're... worse."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I turned to look at her, but the motion sent a curtain of hair swinging against my cheek—a sensation so alien, so </span>
      <span class="c4">intimate</span>
      <span class="c0">, it made me flinch. My hair. It was longer now. Thicker. A deep, rich scarlet that shimmered in the tower’s low light, cascading down my back like a velvet banner.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My throat clenched. I tried to speak again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Tatl, I—" The voice that came out wasn’t mine. It was soft, lush, unmistakably shaped by a different biology. A voice meant for songs, not shouts. Even the </span>
      <span class="c4">act</span>
      <span class="c0"> of speaking felt unfamiliar—like my new body demanded grace, whether I gave it or not.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl recoiled slightly, wings pausing mid-beat. "That... doesn't sound like you're better..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"I know." I touched my throat and winced. My fingers were slimmer, my nails subtly glossed. Even that—</span>
      <span class="c4">that tiny, pointless flourish</span>
      <span class="c0">—felt like a betrayal. A detail I would never have chosen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The Mask Salesman clapped his hands, humming like a man at a garden party. "Ahhh! Such a transformation! A blossom in full bloom! Yes, yes, very good. Quite elegant."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Shut up," I snapped. But the fury didn’t land—it floated out of me like a panicked melody. No edge. No weight.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I needed to </span>
      <span class="c4">see.</span>
      <span class="c0"> I staggered toward the great gear’s polished hub. The metal was scratched and weathered, but there in its center was a clear, silver circle—reflective enough to show the truth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I climbed onto the rim, heart pounding. Then I looked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">The girl in the reflection was beautiful. </span>
      <span class="c4">Painfully</span>
      <span class="c0"> so.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Delicate. Ethereal. A vision sculpted from someone else’s dream.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Her eyes were impossibly bright—emerald green like sunlit forest leaves after rain—wide and shimmering with unspeakable confusion. Thick, dark lashes framed them like delicate shutters. Her face was narrow and heart-shaped, kissed with the faintest blush, and her pouty lips parted in breathless disbelief.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Scarlet hair, deep and dark like fresh-spilled wine, cascaded over her shoulders in glossy waves, some strands clinging damply to the line of her jaw. Her cloak, slightly askew, slipped down from one sculpted shoulder, revealing the delicate slope of her collarbone and the gentle swell of a too-soft form that hadn’t been mine a day ago.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Even her posture betrayed me—hips cocked subtly, legs angled with an accidental grace I hadn’t earned. She looked like someone meant to be protected, not someone who had spent years fighting to protect others.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And when I raised my hand to my mouth in stunned horror... she did the same.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I hated her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'm not... me," I whispered, voice trembling with a grief too sharp to cry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Behind us, the Salesman shuffled forward, hands folded like a prayer. "A miscalculation, perhaps. But one with potential! Oh yes, oh yes, tremendous potential! You still </span>
      <span class="c4">have</span>
      <span class="c0"> your old self, yes yes—it's all right there in the mask."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He pointed behind me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And there it was.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A wooden mask, carved with haunting precision to match my old face. Lifelike. Vacant. A cruel parody of memory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">It stared up at me from the floor like a severed head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What did you do to me?!" I screamed. The words tore out in a high, keening wail...not a roar, not a command....</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A cry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And he only smiled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I am, to be quite fairly honest, unsure what happened. This is most unexpected…" he repeated, placing a long, pale hand against his chin in mock contemplation. His eyes twitched—too bright, too calm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I’d had enough.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I drew my bow in one fluid motion and trained it on the trickster. The silvery string thrummed as it stretched, the light arrow blooming to life with a hiss of power. His smile faltered. He raised both hands in a flutter of alarm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"My, my, my! I do indeed understand your anger! But—please—I do believe I’ve deduced what went wrong, yes I have!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">He turned and gingerly plucked the mask from the floor—</span>
      <span class="c4">my</span>
      <span class="c0"> face, still carved in haunting detail—and held it up with a kind of reverence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"The song I taught you restores spirits broken by fate," he explained, his tone delicate, almost giddy. "But the magic that </span>
      <span class="c4">cursed</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> you—it did more than remold your flesh. It reshaped your </span>
      <span class="c4">soul.</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> Yes, yes! So when the melody did its work, it did not restore what you once were—it </span>
      <span class="c4">sealed</span>
      <span class="c0"> it. It purified what remained and placed it into this mask."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stared at him, horror rising like bile. "So what? I'm stuck like this forever?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I yanked the bowstring tighter. The glowing bolt flared, casting trembling light on his face. "I </span>
      <span class="c4">cannot</span>
      <span class="c0"> be like this forever!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No! Heavens no!" the Salesman sputtered, eyes wide and wild. He sank to one knee, holding the mask out like a holy offering. "If you place this mask upon your face, you will return to your original body. I promise you, young hero! Just please, lower your weapon."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Slowly, I eased the string back. The arrow fizzled, and my shoulders fell with the weight of doubt. I lowered the bow—but not my guard.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stepped forward and took the mask. It was warm. Too warm. Tatl zipped in front of me, placing herself between the mask and my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Link, wait! We can't trust him. What if it’s another trick? You saw what that song did to you. What if this just makes it worse?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I looked past her, straight into the Salesman's pleading gaze. "You have </span>
      <span class="c4">got</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> to be kidding me," I said, my voice trembling on the edge of disbelief. "You expect me to trust you? </span>
      <span class="c4">Look</span>
      <span class="c0"> at me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">The Salesman clasped his hands, eyes shining with desperation. "Please, young hero. You must believe me! You are the only hope this world has. If your body disturbs you so deeply, then yes—place the mask upon your face. And you will be </span>
      <span class="c4">you</span>
      <span class="c0"> again. Yes, yes. I swear it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The mask in my hand pulsed faintly. It almost... called to me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">But so did the ache in my chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">So did the fear in my bones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c20">
      <span class="c0">
        <br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl tried to discourage me, her voice sharp with fear, but I stepped forward anyway. Something in the Salesman’s pleading tone—frantic and too eager—gripped me with a sick sort of hope. I took the eerily familiar mask from his trembling hands, and he rose to his feet, bowing low with theatrical reverence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That mask contains your former spirit, yes yes," he murmured. "Merely putting it on will restore your original shape—it will, it will!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl hovered near the reflective gear, her glow dimmed and uncertain. I turned the mask over slowly in my hands, my stomach knotting. The wood pulsed—warm and strangely alive, like it still remembered the rhythm of my breath. My old face stared up at me. Familiar, yes... but hollow. Lifeless. A fossil of identity.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You really think this will work?" I asked, cringing at the softness still threading my voice. Tatl said nothing. The Salesman nodded with that same unblinking smile.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I hesitated only a moment longer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Then I pressed the mask to my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">It </span>
      <span class="c4">moved</span>
      <span class="c0">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Not like something worn—but something claiming. The back writhed and </span>
      <span class="c4">latched</span>
      <span class="c0">, a vine of bone and memory curling into my skin. My breath caught. My chest seized.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">A muffled scream escaped me as my spine </span>
      <span class="c4">cracked</span>
      <span class="c0">, folding inward with unnatural force. My shoulders wrenched wide, arms stretching, muscle re-forming along their lengths. My hips cinched in sharply, ribs groaning as they collapsed into a narrower frame. My chest flattened with a fiery compression that stole the air from my lungs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Tatl screamed something—but I couldn’t hear it. Not over the </span>
      <span class="c4">tearing</span>
      <span class="c0">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My arms bulked up, joints popping as strength returned like thunder beneath my skin. My legs extended, knees locking, feet reforming with painful cracks as they filled out heavy, mud-caked boots I hadn’t seen in what felt like years.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">With a sickening jolt, weight surged back into my body. I was </span>
      <span class="c4">heavy</span>
      <span class="c0"> again—solid, masculine, grounded. The gentle, swaying grace of my former form vanished beneath returning muscle and grit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And still... the mask clung to me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">It squeezed tighter. It </span>
      <span class="c4">loved</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> me. My jaw stretched, grinding into its old shape. My voice box cinched like a fist closing inside my throat. I gasped, and the sound that came out was deep, ragged— real.... </span>
      <span class="c4">me</span>
      <span class="c0">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">The shifting finally eased, and I collapsed forward, heaving. I could feel the sword and shield heavy on my back, replacing the slender arc of the Great Fairy’s bow. My Kokiri tunic—green, battered, </span>
      <span class="c4">mine</span>
      <span class="c0">—hugged my muscular torso like a returning memory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stumbled toward the reflective gear. Tatl exhaled, her wings trembling with cautious relief.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My boots thudded against the wood as I stepped up. I stared.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Pale blue eyes. Short blond hair. Gauntlets. Warrior’s jaw. The weight of countless battles written across my frame.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The Hero of Time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Thank the gods," I breathed, stunned by the baritone thrum of my own voice. "You were telling the truth."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Indeed, young hero, I was!" the Salesman chirped, folding his hands. "But do remember—it is only temporary. Your </span>
      <span class="c4">spirit</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> is changed, yes yes. Until you retrieve </span>
      <span class="c4">my</span>
      <span class="c0"> mask... I’m afraid it will remain so.""</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c20">
      <span class="c0">
        <br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"But how are we supposed to get it back?" Tatl interjected, her voice sharp with frustration. "Skull Kid is just too powerful now! We could barely even faze him—how are we supposed to </span>
      <span class="c4">defeat</span>
      <span class="c0"> him?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stomped toward the mask salesman, armored boots clanking against the floor, my gauntleted fist clenched with renewed determination.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I can beat him now. I’m back to normal. He’s not going to be a problem."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, no," the Salesman said gravely, shaking his head with a grimace. "Your little friend is quite right. The dark magic within that mask has twisted him, granted him strength beyond comprehension. You would not triumph. You would perish."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"But you </span>
      <span class="c4">just</span>
      <span class="c0"> said I was the only hope!" I snapped. "What, have you changed your mind already?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Heavens, no! You </span>
      <span class="c4">are</span>
      <span class="c0"> the world’s only chance, yes yes!" he said, wringing his hands. "But you cannot defeat this evil with strength alone. No, no, you must heal the wounded hearts and tormented spirits of this land. You must bring them to your side for the final confrontation. Only united, only then, can the mask’s power be truly overcome."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Tatl hovered beside me, wings flickering in disbelief. "Heal the </span>
      <span class="c4">souls</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> of the land? What does that even </span>
      <span class="c4">mean</span>
      <span class="c0">? How does that stop Skull Kid from obliterating everything?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"The mask </span>
      <span class="c4">feeds</span>
      <span class="c0"> on suffering, thrives on hatred and despair!" he declared. "If you undo the pain it has caused, its strength will weaken. That lovely little tune you’ve learned—it will be crucial, yes! Have faith in the melody, have faith in each other!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I crossed my arms, still unsure. "Right... faith. That’s easier said than done. Where exactly do I start? Healing hearts isn’t exactly a sword-swinging sort of quest."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"No, no, it isn’t," the Salesman admitted, his voice now hushed and reverent. "But you have gifts, hero. Gifts you once used to bring joy, long ago. You must wield them again. Just as you did before. I believe in you! You’ve saved a world once—you can save this one, too. It is your </span>
      <span class="c4">destiny</span>
      <span class="c0">, yes indeed!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I stared. My chest tightened. I </span>
      <span class="c4">knew</span>
      <span class="c0"> him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">He really </span>
      <span class="c4">was</span>
      <span class="c0"> the same mask peddler from Hyrule.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I remembered helping him back then, giving away masks across the land. But how did he know about my journey? I’d never told anyone—not even the knights or my friends. Only Princess Zelda knew. How could </span>
      <span class="c4">he</span>
      <span class="c0"> know?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">There was more to this man. Far more.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Okay... I get it." I muttered. "You’re not just some merchant. You’ve seen more than you let on. But if the only way to truly change back is to stop Skull Kid and return your mask... then that’s what I’ll do."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Most excellent! How encouraging indeed!" he exclaimed, practically skipping with joy. "You </span>
      <span class="c4">will</span>
      <span class="c0"> succeed, I know it!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl awkwardly fluttered beside me, glancing at the salesman like he might sprout another head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Uhhh... we should probably get going now, right, Link?" she muttered, nudging my arm. She leaned close and whispered, "This guy really creeps me out. Let’s leave before he does something </span>
      <span class="c4">even</span>
      <span class="c0"> weirder."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ohoho yes! No time for idle chatter, no no! Off you go! The fate of the world waits!" the Salesman laughed, eyes twinkling far too brightly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl zipped behind me in surprise, clearly not expecting to be overheard. I chuckled and shook my head. There was no fear in me now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I was </span>
      <span class="c4">back</span>
      <span class="c0">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah... thanks. For turning me back. I’ll let you know how it goes."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I turned to leave, hand on the wooden doors.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ah! Wait, young hero! One last thing!" the Salesman called, his voice echoing oddly in the chamber.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I paused, groaning softly. There’s </span>
      <span class="c4">always</span>
      <span class="c0"> a catch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You mustn’t wear the mask for long periods," he warned, suddenly grave. "Its magic draws from your spirit. Wear it too long... and you will become a husk. Dust. And with you, hope itself will fade."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I clenched my jaw. Of course. Of </span>
      <span class="c4">course</span>
      <span class="c0"> there was a cost.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Great. So how do I take it off? It’s attached to my face."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Why, like any other mask, of course! Just pull—and off it comes! Hoho!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I rolled my eyes. "Right. Just rip off my face. Got it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">With that, I shook my head, muttering under my breath, and opened the doors. The light poured in—bright and blinding. Tatl hovered at my side, and I stepped forward, leaving the strange chamber behind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The next chapter of my quest had begun.</span>

      <span class="c18 c22">Chapter Thirteen</span>
    </p>
    <h1 class="c13" id="h.m27tymgcmbb9">
      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">Ancient Deadlands</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The destroyed ruins of the archaic temple were filled with a sense of terror and foreboding. Wispy trails of ghostly blue clouds loomed amidst a cold, sunless sky of grey. A lonesome wind howled through the barren wastes of what was once a beautiful woodland full of life. Fossilized trees, and fields of destroyed foundations marked the ancient graveyard of a glorious kingdom, destroyed in some terrible calamity that had been forgotten in the passing of eons. Piles of dusty bones littered the landscape, and not a single living creature roamed the bleak deadlands. Save for one.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A peculiar traveler, tall, lanky, and garbed in elegant clothing, navigated the treacherous ruins. The figure seemed to be hunting for something, stopping every few meters to peer under debris and rummage through charred bone piles. The mysterious stranger continued on like this for hours, patient in his search and methodical in movement. The bitter chill of the howling wind didn't faze the smiling man as it billowed around his clothing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The man's grin widened as he walked closer to the crumbling remains of the temple ruins. He knew in his heart that this was the right place; there could be no mistake. He had searched far and wide, through time and space, and even within the Void of Death itself to behold this doomed land once again. The man knew the domain very well, better than most other worlds, and he skittered with a graceful madness through the sharp, icy rubble and broken buildings. Then the man halted within the shattered walls of what was once a great tower within the demolished temple.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The aberrant fellow moved towards a corner where a huge piece of debris lay, and shifted the impossibly large boulder away with astonishing ease for a man of such a thin stature, revealing a set of stairs underneath. He hopped into the air with glee and giggled in delight, knowing his long, grueling journey was coming to an end. His painstakingly elaborate schemes and eternal dedication would soon be rewarded, and he would finally, after two long centuries of seeking, have...it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The man plodded down the pitch black stairwell, and into a deep passageway without a care in the world. Dusty candles hanging along the walls of the wide passage mysteriously lit around him with icy blue flames, piercing through the lifeless dark ahead. The stone tunnels were remarkably intact and free of blockage as the man excitedly plunged onward. The wind's eerie moaning filled the passageways, and skeletons littered the halls. Any ordinary person would have fled long before venturing into this evil place, but the ageless man was no ordinary being. He sneered at the haunting noise and continued his mission down the seemingly endless corridors. The gentleman knew he was very close now. So close that he could almost taste victory on the tip of his tongue. Nothing would stop him! Nothing would satiate his burning desire! Nothing in all of creation would prevent him from finding his long lost possession! The crazed man chuckled into the blackness ahead. He almost dared something to impede his hunt now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">After hours of silent travelling down the dry, freezing tunnels, the man crowed in triumph.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Here! It must be here!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Before him stood a large stone slab that obstructed the way ahead. It was marked with an all too familiar design. The image displayed a large, solitary eye crying a single drop below the pupil's center. Three sharp points extended evenly above the eye. A large ring, broken into sections by smaller rings with interspersed circles lying over the lines surrounded the oculus. The Eye of the True Sheikah, a symbol that he had known from birth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The Eye began to glow faintly with cyan light as the fearless man approached. He produced a razor sharp dagger from the folds within his clothing, and drew the blade along his open palm. The strange fellow uttered not a single sound, and placed the bloody palm upon the pupil of the eye. Recognizing the purity of the man's blood, the symbol flashed, and the slab began to rumble and move upward into the ceiling. The wound in his hand healed immediately, and he giggled with an insane happiness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The slab revealed a final passage into a massive, sinister- looking chamber, dimly lit by eternally burning torches of purple flame. In the center of the room was a raised platform. Upon it rested a huge, perfectly rounded orb of what appeared to be pure amethyst. As the fanatical man approached, the orb began to hum and vibrate, surrounding itself with a shadowy aura.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"At long, long last! I have finally found you. Yes!" The man cried in pure joy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He moved close to the ominous sphere, placing a pale hand upon it. The orb suddenly hissed and a loud crack resounded through the chamber! The amethyst sphere had disappeared, replaced by a churning, two -dimensional circle of light and darkness that roared with energy. Deep black, red, and gold colors shifted and swirled within the magic window, creating dancing shadows throughout the chamber. A scent of burning steel permeated the area, and magical energy electrified the air. The deranged man clapped his hands gleefully and entered through the portal, vanishing into the tenebrous ring of roiling twilight.</span>

    </h1>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I pushed open the wooden doors of the Clock Tower after finishing with the Happy Mask Salesman, and took a step into the warm sunlight, breathing deeply the fresh morning air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">It smelled right, crisp with dew, faintly sweet from baking bread, and tinged with the earthy scent of damp stone warmed by the sun... but it felt </span>
      <span class="c4">wrong</span>
      <span class="c0">. My body still braced for chaos—muscles taut, eyes flicking to the rooftops as if expecting fire to rain down again. The stillness was unnatural after everything we’d just survived. Even the birdsong felt out of place, like an instrument playing too soon after a funeral.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I swallowed the tension and forced my shoulders to relax. The square had returned to its ordinary rhythm as if the world hadn’t nearly ended hours ago. Birds warbled overhead, flitting between rooftops gilded by golden sunlight. The plaza, so recently wrapped in fire and despair, now shimmered with color and warmth. Children laughed somewhere down a nearby alley, and the hammering of carpenters echoed across the square as the construction crew—now completely unbothered—dutifully repaired the scaffolding they had abandoned in panic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I watched a woman sweep the front step of a bakery, unaware her world had been destroyed and rewoven around her. A musician tuned his instrument on the corner. The sky was spotless... perfect even.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">It was unsettling at first... but I felt unshakable. Alive. My boots gripped the cobblestones with purpose. My shoulders squared, tunic shifting with every step like it knew how I moved. For the first time in what felt like years, I wasn't afraid. The world could burn again and I’d be ready. The bright ball of fairydust beside me, however, looked anything but assured...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Wait a second... what are they still doing here?" Tatl asked, flicking anxiously in the air beside me. "Don’t these people even know what happened?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Hrmmm... I think the only ones who notice time travel are the ones who </span>
      <span class="c4">make</span>
      <span class="c0"> it happen," I said with a confident smirk and a shrug. My voice felt right in my chest. Solid. Grounded. "Or something like that. Someone explained it to me once. I couldn't follow it. The whole thing sounded more like philosophy than magic."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl, the ever-sarcastic little wisp who once hovered around me like a thorn in my side—sharp, jumpy, and never short on complaints—floated beside me now with a strange stillness. Her usual stingers of wit were gone, replaced by a thoughtful hum, as if she finally understood the weight I carried. We weren’t just allies anymore. We were partners. She wouldn’t say it, not yet—but I could feel the shift.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">We had spoken to the Mask Salesman, and as strange and theatrical as he was, he knew things. Deep things. Dangerous things. He told us the truth about Skull Kid’s mask—how it didn’t just manipulate despair, it </span>
      <span class="c4">fed</span>
      <span class="c0"> on it. Every broken heart in Termina was fuel for that cursed thing, and Skull Kid had become more shadow than child.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We couldn’t fight that with swords or bravado. We had to heal the wounds of the world itself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">That’s when he taught us the song.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A strange, haunting melody meant to soothe cursed spirits. And it had worked—though not in the way I expected. When I played it, something inside me shifted. My soul was split—sealed into a mask shaped like the person I used to be. The man. The warrior. The legend.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Now, I wear him like armor. The Hero of Time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">And truthfully? It felt </span>
      <span class="c4">good</span>
      <span class="c7 c6">. My stride was sure, my voice steady, my instincts sharp. I didn’t flinch from shadows anymore—I </span>
      <span class="c4">welcomed</span>
      <span class="c0"> them. If this mask was a lie, it was one I could live with. Because when I looked ahead, I saw a road that would demand blood and resolve, not softness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">So here we were, back at the start—Clock Town bathed in gold, its cobblestone streets echoing with the casual clamor of a world reset. The towering Clock Tower loomed above, elegant and ageless, as if daring time to challenge it again. Sunlight spilled over the plaza, washing away the chill left by the Salesman's haunting smile and cryptic warnings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Okay, Link," Tatl buzzed at my side, her wings catching the light. "What do we do now?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I tilted my head up toward the clear sky, where the moon once hung like a blade. Now it was distant again—innocuous, expressionless...just a hunk of space rock. The people below had no idea how close they'd come.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Not sure," I answered, my baritone confident and amused. The Hero’s Mask felt perfect, like an old uniform fitting better than ever. "Your turf, not mine. You’re the expert here."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl twirled thoughtfully in the air, tapping her tiny fingers to her chin. "Anju, maybe? She always seemed to know stuff."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I winced at the name. I remembered her kindness... and I remembered leaving her behind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No," I said flatly. "She wouldn’t recognize us anyway. We're the only ones carrying the memory of what happened. Let's not add to any more confusion than is already in this town."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Tatl rolled her eyes, mimicking the Salesman's singsong tone. "Well then, where do we go, </span>
      <span class="c4">young hero</span>
      <span class="c0">?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I chuckled and nodded toward a group of guards up the street. Sunlight glinted off their armor as they marched lazily across the plaza, clearly more bark than bite. Perfect.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Time to introduce myself," I muttered with a cocky grin. I signaled Tatl and strode forward with purpose. My boots struck the stones with a reassuring rhythm. Sword at my side, shield at my back—I looked every bit the part.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Gentlemen!" I boomed, loud enough to command their attention. "I hear there’s trouble in this land. I’m new here, sure—but I’m no tourist. I’m a warrior, and I came to help. So—where’s the fire?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The portliest of them raised an eyebrow before letting out a snort. "Ooooh, look out lads! We’ve got ourselves a hero! Wahahaha!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The others burst into laughter, loud and stupid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Just because you’ve got some shiny gear and a talking glowbug doesn’t make you anything special!" the ringleader jeered, wiping a tear from his eye. "Go home, kid. We’ve got real soldiers on this side of the wall."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My hand angrily reached toward my sword. I barely reached the man's shoulder, but I didn’t need height to carve through arrogance. He wasn’t a soldier—he was a clown dressed in hand-me-down armor. I could end this entire conversation with a single swing. Tatl, quick as ever, darted in front of me and grabbed the steel brace of my gauntlet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What are you doing?!" she hissed, wings buzzing with tension. "I thought you wanted to help people, not get tossed in a dungeon! There's more of them than us, genius!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hahaha! Better listen to your tiny friend, kid! Now get out of our sight before we actually throw you in jail for threatening us... and mocking the law!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I met their laughter with a slow, controlled glare. I could’ve humiliated all of them in five seconds flat. But Tatl was right. I was here to save this world, not beat up its idiots. I stomped away, letting the stomp of my boots echo with restrained fury.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"So, all the town guards here are about as useful as a wet paper knife," I muttered, brushing bits of hay that had drifted from one of the carts off my tunic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Tatl zipped around to my side. "Seriously, what was </span>
      <span class="c4">that</span>
      <span class="c0">? You just marched up to them like a cocky sword boy looking for a duel. Who even are you right now?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I dunno," I shrugged, flashing a lopsided grin. "Just... feels good to be me again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Well, tone it down, hero. You're starting to sound like one of </span>
      <span class="c4">them</span>
      <span class="c0">. Maybe that mask’s making you act all puffed up."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Nah, it’s fine," I replied, waving her off. "I just gotta get used to feeling this strong again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl narrowed her eyes but let it go. "Alright then, what now? The guards are clearly useless."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah. Time to think."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"The Great Fairy maybe?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Not unless she’s relocated from that park. That place and I aren’t exactly on good terms," I grumbled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I shifted off toward a quiet corner near a crooked mailbox by a crumbling stairway. A flicker of yellow and blue flashed from the alley nearby—something darting away. I ignored it. The world could wait a second.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I leaned on the mailbox, the sun glinting off its worn red exterior. "Healing the hearts and souls of the land"—what the hell was that supposed to mean? I needed direction, not riddles.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A small kid wearing a yellow Keaton mask brushed past me. He had sky-blue hair and carried himself like someone with a mission. He paused, stood on tiptoe, and slipped a pristine letter into the mailbox slot. I barely glanced at him. Just another piece in this strange, ticking town.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Back during my previous adventure in Hyrule, it seemed the path had always been lit ahead of me. All I had to do was listen to Navi—my, at the time, very annoying fairy companion—who thankfully had returned to the Kokiri Forest once her work was done. As shrill and irksome as she was, the blue pixie had always known exactly where to go next.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl, on the other hand, seemed just as lost as I was. Still, if given the choice, I’d take her over Navi any day. Abrasive sarcasm was easier to stomach than the constant barrage of "Hey! Look! Listen!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">With no other leads to chase, I finally gave in to Tatl’s earlier suggestion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I've got nothing... I guess we can go talk to Anju," I muttered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The boy in the yellow Keaton mask gasped and bolted into the alley at the mention of her name. Something about him prickled at the edge of my memory—but it slipped away before I could grab it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"See??" Tatl huffed, floating just above my shoulder. "You should've just listened to me from the start."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Whatever. Let's move. I'd rather get to where we’re needed before it’s too late."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Pffft. Too late? You can bend time now, remember? We’ve got all the time in the world."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"That’s exactly why we shouldn’t waste it," I said. "Time is dangerous. You can’t just rewind the world forever without consequences. If you mess with it too much, it </span>
      <span class="c4">breaks</span>
      <span class="c0">."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Wait... seriously?" Tatl’s tone shifted from teasing to curious. "How do you even know that? You don’t look old enough to know how to shave, let alone time travel."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I smiled wryly. "I’ve got stories. Just not ones I feel like reliving. I came here to forget that part of my life... but I guess trouble follows me like a shadow."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I’ve noticed," Tatl said, more gently this time. "So let me get this straight. You ran from all of it—war, destiny, trauma—and wound up back in the thick of it anyway? Transformed and everything?" She buzzed closer, her glow dimmer, more reflective. "That’s... rough. Hero work sounds like a curse."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I didn’t answer right away. The rising sun painted long shadows behind the rooftops and fences, and the scent of fresh bread mixed with smoke drifted through the cobbled street. Bells chimed faintly in the distance as stalls opened for the day.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"It is a curse sometimes," I said. "But it’s also a duty. I didn’t choose this life. But maybe it chose me. And if it did, then I have to carry it, whether I like it or not."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl hovered beside me, quiet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"For what it's worth," she finally said, her voice softer than I’d ever heard it, "I think you’re one of the strongest people I’ve ever met. And I don’t mean because of your sword. I mean... just </span>
      <span class="c4">you</span>
      <span class="c0">. The way you keep going."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I nodded, not trusting myself to speak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And as the two of us continued on through the awakening streets—through the noise and color and clamor—I realized something. Tatl wasn’t just a guide, she was a companion...one who saw more than she let on.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And for now... that was enough.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">By the time we fought our way through the jostling crowds to the Stock Pot Inn, the sun blazed directly overhead, casting stark, golden light across the cobblestones. The moon still looked deceptively normal—its silver face soft and full above the rooftops—but a wrongness clung to it, subtle at first. As we walked, the expression seemed to shift ever so slightly, like a trick of the eye. The curve of a frown. The suggestion of eyes too deep, too knowing. It loomed a bit larger now, and a smoky haze began to gather at its edges like breath on glass. But no one looked up. Laughter and music filled the air as merchants hawked glittering wares and children darted beneath the legs of distracted shoppers. The festival clung to the town like a fevered dream, blinding everyone to the end creeping ever closer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Each person I nudged past felt heavier than the last. My boots dragged, thudding dully against the uneven stone as if the weight of the world were pulling me down. My breath grew shorter, and the smell of roasted meat, perfume, and sweat churned my stomach. By the time we reached the inn’s battered oak door, I was stumbling, half-draped over it for support. I pressed my forehead against the sun-warmed wood, blinking hard to stop the street from spinning. My fingers fumbled at the doorknob, and then the dizziness won. I doubled over, knees nearly buckling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Link! What's wrong? Are you ok?!" Tatl’s voice pierced the noise, her glow flaring with urgency. "Wait...wait—your mask! You have to take it off, remember? The salesman warned you not to wear it for too long!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Her words hit like a bucket of ice. In the rush of familiarity—of feeling whole again—I’d completely forgotten. The mask. My supposed return to self. But this body was a lie, one that fed on my spirit. My breath came in ragged bursts as I staggered sideways to brace against the cool stone wall, my gauntleted hand leaving a smear of sweat on the surface.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I could feel the tremor in my limbs, the way my heart raced too fast, too shallow. My strength was ebbing—siphoned away, moment by moment—just to keep the mask’s illusion alive.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Come on! You have to remove the mask!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I looked around, I couldn't change here. There were too many witnesses, and with my luck I would be burned at the stake for shape shifting if I was seen. "I...I can't...take it off here in..the open, Tatl!" I gasped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well..umm...ok..." Tatl glanced around for a hiding place, then pointed, "There! Through that alley!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She gestured to the narrow gap we had leapt over the previous morning, and I nodded wearily, slowly shambling towards the corridor. The few citizens who saw me laughed, thinking I was probably drunk. Tatl and I ignored them as I entered the shaded alley and I collapsed to the dirty, stone ground. I fought to move my armored gauntlets to my face. I managed to roll onto my back, and began to tug on my cheeks, hoping that the magical mask would pull free.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As I tugged at the mask’s edge, I felt my skin resist—like it didn’t want to let go. My vision doubled and then fractured like shattered glass, each shard humming with memories not entirely mine. My fingers felt like they were digging into warm wax, peeling back something alive and reluctant. Then—snap!—the mask came free, and with it, a breathless rush of cold air and physical collapse.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c27">
      <span class="c0">A pulse of searing heat surged through my chest, and I doubled over with a strangled gasp. My bones crunched inward, not breaking, but rearranging—like an invisible sculptor was molding clay with impatient hands. My armor clanked loosely against shrinking shoulders. My lungs seized for air, my breath hitching as my ribcage narrowed and my voice broke into something higher, softer, laced with panic and shame.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c11 c27">
      <span class="c0">The change rippled outward... hair spilling like spilled ink down my neck, fingers tapering, hips flaring, a sickening swirl of motion in my gut that wasn’t pain so much as displacement. I could feel the curve of my breasts swell again beneath my tunic, the fabric stretching taut over the form I hadn’t yet accepted. A wave of helplessness clung to my skin like sweat. Then it was over. I was smaller, fragile, trembling—and unmistakably her again. My clothes even began to shimmer and transform right along with me! A few seconds later the transformation was over, and I heaved in deep breaths of air, feeling the unfortunate weight of breasts upon my chest again. I sat against the wall, chest rising and falling rapidly. My hands trembled as I brushed tangled bangs from my eyes...eyes that felt wider now, more vulnerable. I swallowed down the ache in my throat and stared at the mask lying on the ground beside me. It glinted in the light like a cruel joke, silent and inert. I didn’t know whether to be grateful for it… or afraid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Ughhh... </span>
      <span class="c4">gasp</span>
      <span class="c7 c6">...if it's going to be like this every time...</span>
      <span class="c4">huff</span>
      <span class="c0">...then I'm really going to consider keeping the mask on," I groaned, my voice now unmistakably soft—gently pitched, with that haunting lilt I still wasn’t used to.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I pushed myself up with trembling arms, feeling the familiar tightness of my body return—feminine, compact, curved. I looked down and adjusted my tangled forest green cloak, pulling it behind me with a frustrated tug. My form-fitting dark brown tunic hugged close to my now-supple frame, cinched at the waist by the leather belt I had almost forgotten I wore. The tight black pants stretched snugly over my hips and thighs, now smaller but unmistakably shaped. The chill of the stone beneath my deerskin boots had crept through me—how long had I been lying there?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I grumbled, brushing a clump of dried alley grit from my thigh and leaning down to pluck the Hero’s Mask from the dirt. It felt heavier now. Not in weight, but in meaning. I held it for a beat too long before sighing and tucking it behind my belt on my right hip, as far from my heart as I could manage.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I can't say I blame you. That looked like it really hurt," Tatl said gently, her voice quieter than usual. "I don't envy your position one bit. Umm... no offense."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Gee, thanks..." I muttered, brushing my crimson bangs from my eyes. The strands were longer again—thick and soft, clinging to my cheeks. Everything about me was soft now, inside and out. I hated how easy it had become to move in this form. Hated that my body knew what to do before I did.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Let's just go," I mumbled, voice edged with weariness. "Listening to me whine won't get us anywhere."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I shuffled out of the shaded alleyway and into the midday glow. Warm air hit my skin like silk. A breeze fluttered the hem of my cloak and cooled the sweat at my neck. Just ahead, the Stock Pot Inn's familiar wooden door rose into view like the promise of rest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">But before I could reach it, a troupe of circus performers and street dancers turned the corner in a lively swarm of silk and tambourines. They flooded the square in a kaleidoscope of color and laughter, blocking the entrance as they queued in a snaking line, chattering excitedly about their performances.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stopped, letting out a sigh through my nose.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh come on!" Tatl yelled. "That's just rude!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh! My apologies, ladies!" One of the colorful performers turned and bowed with exaggerated grace, his voice dripping with theatrical charm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Please do excuse our frightful rudeness. The others are a bit grumpy, you see!" An almost exact replica of the first performer offered a mirrored bow, his tone equally flamboyant. "You may surely go ahead of us, if you like?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The performers were identical twins, unmistakable not just in appearance but in spirit. Each had a thick, bushy brown mustache that curled at the ends like the flourishes of a calligrapher’s pen. They wore extravagant jester costumes adorned with diamond patterns, puffy sleeves, and layered collars that wobbled with every movement. Their pointy cloth shoes curled upward at the toes, ending in golden bells that jingled with every exaggerated gesture.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">One brother was clad primarily in crimson with sapphire trim, the other in deep azure with crimson accents. Their silk hats sagged under the weight of more bells, swaying with each bounce of their heads. Shocks of flat brown hair jutted out from beneath their caps like awkward feathers, and both had the same twinkling blue eyes—eyes that held mischief, but also a surprising depth of warmth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Slung from their belts were pouches of juggling balls in every color imaginable. With a practiced flourish, they each pulled two balls into their palms and began juggling in synchronized rhythm, tossing and catching in perfect unison. The bright orbs glittered as they spun through the air, catching sunlight like jewels. Onlookers cheered from behind them, clapping in time with the acrobatic display.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Umm...sure? Why not." I nodded. "Are you guys here for the carnival?" I had almost forgotten about the annual festival.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yes, as a matter of fact we are!" One twin declared with a flourish, spinning a juggling ball on his fingertip.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Although I doubt we'll be staying long..." The other twin stuck a thumb up, gesturing to the sky. The moon high above had begun to shift again—its once calm, silvery surface slowly warping into grotesque animation. Cracks formed along its surface like splitting porcelain, revealing the cursed face beneath: wide, sunken eyes full of menace and a snarling, lipless grin that seemed to stretch across the sky. Its gaze bore down on the town like a wrathful god's judgment. "That little man in the moon seems to be a bit cranky today! Hohoho!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You could almost say this only happens once in a blue moon! Ohohoho!" The juggler dressed in blue chuckled, juggling three brightly-colored orbs that sparkled in the light.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl and I shrugged at each other, neither one of us finding the joke funny.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, but did you hear about the swamp?" The red juggler asked, leaning in with mock secrecy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Uhhh no?" I braced myself for another horrible joke. "What about the swamp?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"They say there was a kidnapping!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh my, a kidnapping? Did they catch the culprit?!" The blue juggler gasped dramatically, hands thrown to his cheeks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, because the kid woke up! Aaaahahahaha!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The twins erupted into hysterical laughter, clutching their sides and nearly dropping their juggling balls. I rolled my eyes and groaned, while Tatl planted a tiny glowing palm against her face in absolute disgust.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ahaha! I slay myself! Ohohoho!" the red juggler wheezed, kicking his curled shoe in glee.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"With jokes like that, you could also slay the horrifying monster that's haunting the swamp! Haha!" the blue juggler cackled, spinning on his heel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl perked up, her wings flickering with sudden interest. "Wait...are you guys still joking? Or is there seriously trouble in the swamp?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"By my stubble, I'd say there was double trouble poison bubbles! Hohoho!" Red sang, throwing a juggling ball skyward.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Both Tatl and I groaned in unison, loud and exasperated, turning away to spare ourselves from further auditory punishment. The line into the inn had finally begun to move, and I silently prayed we'd be inside before another pun found its way into the air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Wait wait! We're sorry, truly we are!" the twins confessed in perfect chorus. They somersaulted in unison and landed with hands pressed together in apology. "It's just that we're entertainers, you see—bringing laughter is our solemn vow!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Except no one really finds us funny..." Red admitted, his shoulders sagging as one of his juggling balls slipped and rolled away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Tis truth," Blue nodded, managing to catch his before it hit the ground. His voice turned more serious as his eyes darted toward the eastern horizon. "But despite our buffoonery, there really is danger in the swamplands."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Danger indeed," Red added gravely. "The waters are sick, the creatures twisted. People vanish without a trace. Even the wind feels heavier there."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">
        The blue juggler's face darkened as he leaned forward. "Something ancient stirs in the murk. The locals whisper of shadows with teeth, of spirits gone mad. It’s not just superstition anymore."
        <br/>
        The two of them shivered in unison, I couldn't tell if it was genuine or just to add to their theatrics.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Wait a tic!" Blue suddenly exclaimed, snapping the moment. "That’s a fine-looking bow on your back! Are you a hunter? Or an adventurer perhaps?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I reached instinctively for the bow, the polished blue wood cool beneath my fingers. I had nearly forgotten it was there—so light and perfectly balanced, the Great Fairy's gift felt like an extension of my will.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ooo, maybe she can slay the monster!" Blue quipped, resuming a gentle juggling pattern as he circled with glee.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Oh yes! Then perhaps we could travel to the Deku Kingdom like we were supposed to do in the first place!" Red rejoiced, spinning dramatically. "No one seems to care how hard we work when we're in Clock Town... always laughing at us, never </span>
      <span class="c4">with</span>
      <span class="c0"> us."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl hovered close to my ear. "They’re strange… but I think they’re being honest now. Maybe the swamp is where we need to go next."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I nodded quietly, casting one last glance at the twins, who now juggled with practiced sorrow. Their painted smiles didn’t quite reach their eyes anymore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl drifted close, her glow dim and purposeful, nudging my left arm with the back of her wings. "I think that's what we needed, Link. Now let’s get a move on before they notice we’re gone!" she whispered, not wanting to risk another pun assault.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">But we weren’t fast enough.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Ah, Link!" Blue suddenly called, locking eyes with me and giving a theatrical bow. "What an... </span>
      <span class="c4">interesting</span>
      <span class="c0"> name for a pretty little ranger such as yourself!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Tatl audibly groaned and slapped a glowing palm over her face. "You’ve </span>
      <span class="c4">got</span>
      <span class="c0"> to be kidding me..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Umm... thanks? I guess?" I replied, my voice flat and cautious. I began inching away, throwing on the politest smile I could muster. "Look, guys, we really need to get going. But thanks for the tip. Seriously—that was helpful."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh sure, no problem!" they chimed in perfect chorus. “Though you know, a tip might be—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I didn’t wait to find out what their tip might be. I took off mid-sentence, sprinting through the bustling crowd before they could weaponize another punchline. Tatl zipped after me with a grateful sigh, weaving through the air like an arrow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Once we rounded the corner and put a few buildings between us and the jugglers, I stopped to catch my breath and leaned against the side of a flower shop.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Okay… </span>
      <span class="c4">whew</span>
      <span class="c0">... at least we know where we’re going now. Where’s the nearest gate to the swamp?" I asked, still panting slightly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Tatl huffed, hovering with her arms crossed in mock indignation. "Oh </span>
      <span class="c4">sure</span>
      <span class="c0">, just dash off and leave me to suffer with the court jesters! If I had to hear one more awful joke, I’d have chucked myself into a well."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I smirked and brushed a crimson strand of hair behind my ear. "Hey, I figured you’d be right behind me. No need to get all grumpy!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You’re lucky I like you," she muttered, but there was no heat in her words—only relief. "But yes, the gate to the swamp should be over on the south end of town. It was that gate nearest to the Star Chamber. You know where to go from here, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'm still not entirely familiar with this city." I shrugged. "I think it'd be best if you led the way again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Okay, but you're gonna pay for leaving me behind like that, hehe!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl zipped ahead like a mischievous spark, darting between vendor stalls and colorful awnings with the giddy vengeance of a fairy who knew how to make me chase. I took off after her, weaving through the bustling crowd of townsfolk and ducking under clotheslines and banners strung across the street. The morning sun gleamed off the cobblestones, the scent of roasted nuts and fresh linen swirling in the air. A group of musicians played a jaunty tune in the plaza nearby, and a child ran past me with a bright ribbon trailing in her hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I was just getting my rhythm when Tatl suddenly stopped midair at a sharp turn near a flower stall, her wings frozen mid-flutter. I skidded to a halt, nearly bumping into her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Her glow had dimmed, pulsing softly in a rhythm that suggested unease. "Did you hear that?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hear what?" I asked, glancing around at the morning bustle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She tilted her head. "I swear I thought I heard someone call for help... it was faint, but it came from that alley up ahead."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The joy of the festival melted from my thoughts as I followed her gaze. The alley beyond the archway lay in shadow, quiet and oddly still. A hush lingered there that didn’t match the rest of the street’s energy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"C'mon, let’s go see! Maybe you’ll get to be a hero here after all!" Tatl teased, but her voice carried a thread of urgency.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Without another word, she shot forward, disappearing into the gloom.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And with a quiet sigh and the echo of bootsteps at my back, I dashed after her yet again...</span>

    </p>
    <h1 class="c13" id="h.asuqgiqvp53q">
      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">Troublesome Town</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The hum of Clock Town's South District swallowed us whole. I just barely managed to keep up with Tatl as the darting fairy zigzagged through the crowded backstreets. The buildings here leaned closer, casting long shadows that never quite lifted even under the noontime sun. Faded paint peeled from old signs, and warped awnings sagged with grime. Stalls clustered in tight rows, their vendors more sullen than cheerful, hawking wares with weary calls that sounded more like warnings. The scent wasn’t grilled meat and sweets anymore—it was smoke, oil, old bread, and something slightly metallic that lingered too long in the nostrils.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Without my mask, I wasn’t particularly intimidating. I had to practically dance through the cluster of townsfolk, dodging elbows and stepping over crates, sleeping dogs, and half-rotted fruit spilling from busted carts. My smaller frame got jostled constantly, and I was tossed to and fro as the crowd surged around me. Tatl must have seen me lagging behind, because I caught sight of her hovering just above a quieter alleyway a few meters ahead, her glow dimming with a rare stillness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I finally burst free from the knot of bodies, chest heaving slightly, and found Tatl hovering in place above a narrow, dim corridor choked with shadow. Her glow pulsed in sharp, cautious flickers, her eyes locked on something ahead. I started to ask why she’d stopped so abruptly, but she raised a tiny, pale hand to shush me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"There it is again! Listen..." she whispered, wings barely fluttering.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stilled beside her, letting the city's din simmer into background noise. Distant shouting. A drunken laugh. The rattle of a cart wheel catching a stone. But under it all, barely audible—like a breath beneath a storm—I heard it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Help... someone help me..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl turned sharply toward one of the cement walkways branching off the main road. It was narrow, shaded, the kind of place no one paid attention to unless they were already lost.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"It sounds like it’s coming from over there," I said, gesturing. "But... don’t we have somewhere to be? There’s bigger fish to fry in the swamp."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl whirled around to face me, arms crossed. "Was that supposed to be a joke? Way to poke fun at someone else’s misfortune."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Her glare faltered as I raised an eyebrow, amused.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey, don't give me that look! You know what I meant. Come on. If someone’s in trouble, we check it out. That’s what heroes do, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey! There are more important things, Tatl! This is a city—there's always going to be trouble somewhere." I crossed my arms. "And besides, when did you start caring? You usually just mock people’s pain—mine included. What's with the sudden conscience, huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl zipped up to my face, wings buzzing in irritation. Her mouth opened, ready to snap back—then closed again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Maybe it's because I'm trying to save my brother." Her voice cracked as her anger dimmed into something quieter. "And... maybe... I'm trying to save myself."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I blinked, caught off guard by the honesty.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What do you mean? As long as you stick with me, the moon won’t fall on you—if that’s what you’re afraid of."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, that’s not it!" she snapped, exasperated. "You don’t get it, Link. I've done terrible things. I helped Skull Kid—I laughed at his pranks, I encouraged him! And now... after everything we saw, after what he became... I can’t just pretend I wasn’t part of it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She hovered uncertainly, then added in a hushed tone, "I need to do something right. Even if it’s small. Even if it’s just helping one person."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Before I could respond, another pained cry rang out, sharper this time. A gruff voice followed: "Shut up, wimp!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl flinched, wings quivering.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I exhaled slowly and gave a reluctant nod. "You’re right. I haven’t exactly been thinking clearly either. Heroes don’t get to pick who’s worth saving. Everyone matters. And… if you’re trying to make things right—then I respect that, Tatl."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Her glow softened. Together, we crept to the corner of the walkway. I leaned against the wall of a crumbling stone house and peeked around.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The person calling for help, a boy around my age it looked like, was cornered several meters down an alleyway, surrounded by three older men who looked more like castoffs from a rotting pirate ship than citizens of a peaceful town. One of them shoved the boy against a wall, laughter thick with menace. I couldn’t see the kid’s face yet, just his tangled black hair and thin limbs curled protectively.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl's light strobed in anger, casting a flickering glow across the shadowed alley walls. I reached instinctively for the mask at my belt. Time to be a hero again—or so I thought.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">No one else bothered to help the boy, it seemed. The few shameful cowards that strolled along the walkway outside the alley pretended not to see, skirting the confrontation with their eyes fixed on the ground. I glared at them, disgusted by their indifference, by the way they made themselves ghosts in the presence of violence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You have to go help that kid, Link!" Tatl shouted, her voice sharp in my ear like a cracked bell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Owww! Geez! Not so loud!" I flinched and covered my ear. "I can hear you just fine without the audio assault."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Sorry, but look! We gotta help! Those creeps are twice his size! Who knows what they're gonna do to him!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah, yeah, I'm on it... hang on."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I reached for my mask, fingers brushing the smooth wood where it hung at my belt. I braced myself for the usual pull—the searing heat, the painful twist of bone and flesh that marked my transformation. I pressed the mask to my face... and nothing happened. Cold wood. Dead weight.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">My heart thudded once in confusion. I lowered the mask, turned it in my hands. It looked fine. I tried again. Still nothing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What's wrong? Why isn't it working?" Tatl asked, panic creeping into her voice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I don't know... Do you think the salesman tricked us? Maybe it was only supposed to work once?" I muttered, shaking the mask as if that might jolt some forgotten magic back into it. "Feels useless now."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"But why would he lie? He needs you to get his mask back. What would he gain by screwing you over?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Good point," I muttered. "Maybe it needs time to recharge."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Tatl hovered closer, wings twitching anxiously. "You </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">did</span>
      <span class="c2"> wear it for a long time. The Salesman said it draws from your spirit. If you used too much of yourself... maybe you need to recover before you can transform again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">The boy cried out again, his voice ragged and desperate—a raw, unfiltered panic that sliced through the chaos of the alleyway. It hit me like a gut-punch, bypassing reason, bypassing fear. I placed the useless Hero’s Mask back on my belt, my hands trembling with frustration. My soul—my </span>
      <span class="c4">self</span>
      <span class="c0">—was still too hollow to summon its power.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I wasn’t just powerless.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I was trapped in the wrong skin again, and someone needed saving.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I froze for a heartbeat, listening to the pitiful cries echo from deeper in the alley. My body—slight and lithe, foreign and fragile—offered no reassurance. These weren’t just schoolyard bullies. These were grown men. Monsters, really. Hardened criminals with blood on their hands and no fear of consequence. I couldn’t fight them head-on. Not like this.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">But I did have the bow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>“</span>
      <span class="c0">Hey, we can’t just stand here and do nothing!” Tatl zipped in front of me, her wings flickering with urgency. “You’ve gotta stop them!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Ugh... fine. But if I get pummeled, I’m blaming </span>
      <span class="c4">you</span>
      <span class="c0">."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She didn’t argue.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I sprinted toward the alleyway, my pulse thundering in my ears. The scene slammed into me like a blow to the chest. The group of brutish men—grimy, mean-eyed, and thick with cruelty—had already worked the boy over. He was crumpled on the ground, one arm twisted awkwardly beneath him, the other draped over his head in a feeble attempt at defense. Blood smeared the cobblestones near his mouth, and his breath came in short, panicked gasps. The men loomed above him like vultures, laughing, kicking at his sides with sick delight, savoring every flinch. I couldn’t yet see his face clearly, but he was scrawny—fragile in a way that made their assault feel monstrous.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I skidded to a stop just outside the mouth of the alley. Their stench hit me even from the entrance, a vile blend of body odor, sour ale, and the metallic tang of blood. Every instinct screamed at me to run—but I squared my stance, drew a shaky breath, and stepped into view.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey!" I shouted, voice wavering. "Leave that kid alone!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The words left my mouth brittle and too high-pitched, barely cutting through the suffocating silence of the alley. They bounced off the bricks like glass shattering—delicate, ineffective. I winced at the echo, hating how weak I sounded, how far I'd fallen from the commanding presence I once took for granted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The degenerates turned toward me, halting their assault on the collapsed boy. He lay in a crumpled heap near the alley wall, blood streaking from his mouth, his limbs limp and unmoving. Upon seeing me, the attackers erupted into derisive laughter, clearly mistaking my smaller frame for weakness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Leading them was a greasy, unsavory man with matted, orangish hair slicked to one side and pustules peppering his unwashed face. His yellow chaps were stained and frayed, and his boots were so worn the soles flapped. Two rust-pocked cutlasses hung at his waist from a scarred leather belt. His torso, glistening with sweat, was only half-covered by a black vest emblazoned with a faded skull insignia, parted to expose his hairy, grime-caked chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wahaha! Lookie here, boys! Fresh meat!" he bellowed in a grating accent, clearly amused. "The cute mouse thinks she’s gonna tangle with alley cats, huh? Let’s show ‘er how we play, Zip."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A towering brute stepped forward, easily twice my size. A jagged scar tore through his left brow, and crude ink covered his thick arms in twisted designs. His eyes, bloodshot and sunken, traveled over me with vile hunger. He licked his cracked lips as he drew a curved knife from the folds of his grimy coat, stepping over the injured boy like he was a pile of garbage.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Heheheh… You’re right, Faz," he sneered. "C’mere, sweet thing. I like my meat rare."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c20">
      <span class="c2">
        <br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">He advanced slowly, savoring the moment with a sick grin that promised more than just violence. The way his eyes lingered on me wasn’t just predatory—it was possessive, calculating. Behind him, the rest of the gang snickered, their amusement cruel and cold, emboldened by the thought of what Zip might do once he got his hands on me. My breath hitched; terror had me by the throat, curling cold fingers down my spine. But even as panic tried to root me to the ground, instinct surged up and overrode it. I yanked the Great Fairy’s bow from my back, my fingers trembling, slick with sweat, my pulse thudding in my ears. </span>
      <span class="c6">The leather grip pressed into my palm, grounding me. The polished wood thrummed beneath my fingers like it recognized me, like it was waiting. </span>
      <span class="c0">I held my ground, heart pounding, breath shallow. Even afraid, even trembling, I wouldn't let them see me break.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>“</span>
      <span class="c0">If you come one step closer to me, I swear you'll regret it!" I shakily warned, terrified to find out exactly which images played through the gangsters' sick minds. The men laughed at my threat, hearing the fearful quaver in my voice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Faz threw his head back and roared with laughter. "Shoot what, darlin’? You ain’t got any arrows! That’s just a pretty stick!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As Zip took another step forward, menace radiating from his hulking frame, I instinctively drew the string. Once again, a brilliant shaft of light flared to life—startling, radiant, alien. I gasped, still unfamiliar with the magic of the bow, but I didn’t lower it. I let the bolt loose with practiced release of the drawstring.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c4">FWAAAAHHHSSSSSsss</span>
      <span class="c0">!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Zip halted mid-step, his eyes bulging wide in pained surprise. He looked down to find that the searing beam of light had punched straight through his chest like a lance of molten glass. A smoking, cauterized tunnel cut clean through flesh and bone, the air instantly thick with the choking stench of scorched leather and charred meat. My stomach lurched as the acrid heat clawed its way into my lungs. The edges of the wound hissed and spat, tiny sparks arcing from the seared hole like embers dancing off a forge.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">The man gasped, a wet, rattling sound, and spat a splatter of dark blood onto the cobblestones. His sword clanged to the ground. For a heartbeat, he stood—then his knees buckled. His hulking frame toppled forward with a deafening </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">THUD</span>
      <span class="c2">, kicking up a puff of dirt and ash. One last twitch... then silence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The other thugs froze. All their cruel bravado drained in an instant. They stared at me—not with anger, but with true, visceral horror. And for the first time... they looked afraid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wha... you... you fracking killed 'im! My goddess-damned BEST MAN!" Faz cried, voice shrill and cracking with disbelief.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">I stood there stunned, the bow still humming softly in my grip. That wasn’t my intention. I hadn’t even </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">known</span>
      <span class="c2"> the weapon could do that. The power of it... the raw, merciless power had taken even me by surprise.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I exhaled slowly, shaking, finally releasing the breath that had locked in my chest. My fingers still quivered around the grip. Swallowing hard, I lifted my chin and met the thugs’ horrified gazes with steel in my eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I warned you," I said, voice low and cold, the fear now buried beneath something sharper. I pulled the bowstring again, another bolt of light flaring to life between my fingers, humming with deadly promise. "Let the boy go. Or you're next."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The renegades scrambled over each other as they tried to flee down the alley, leaving Zip's still warm corpse behind. Tatl hovered silently over my shoulder, wings humming low, her usual sharp commentary replaced with stunned silence. The boy they had cornered—the one I had thought barely conscious—dragged himself upright with a sharp wince. He limped over to the body, fists clenched, and with a cry somewhere between pain and triumph, kicked Zip’s corpse with all the strength he could muster. The dull thud echoed in the alley. Thick, red blood poured from the gaping wound, snaking between cobblestones before vanishing into a nearby gutter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Take that, you sick bastard!" the youth spat, his voice raw. "You deserved every bit of pain you got!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Up close, I could see the damage the gang had done to him. His blue cotton shirt was torn at the seams, clinging to a frame that was wiry and bruised. The white vest he wore—frayed at the edges—had the number "three" stitched in red thread on the back, identifying him as one of the Bombers. His baggy dark blue trousers hung awkwardly on his slim frame, the waistband cinched with a rope instead of a belt. He looked about my age—seventeen, maybe eighteen—but carried the hardness of someone older. His black hair stuck out in scraggly tufts, tangled and damp with sweat. Grey-green eyes, sharp and intelligent despite the swelling, scanned the alley as if still expecting more danger. A bruise blossomed along his cheek, and a darkening black eye turned his gaze into a lopsided scowl. His jaw was squared with stubborn pride, and despite the limp and the bruises, he stood like someone who refused to stay down.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">After he was finished kicking and stomping on Zip's lifeless body, the boy turned toward me, breath ragged and chest heaving, his sea green eyes burning bright with disbelief and awe.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You... you saved my life," he said, voice hoarse, cracking not from weakness but from the weight of it all. Tears spilled freely now, tracking down bloodied cheeks. "You have no idea what they were going to do to me... what this sick bastard was going to do to me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">He lashed out again at Zip’s body, his foot striking the limp corpse with a vengeance that echoed like a punctuation mark. Tatl flinched, her light flickering as she hovered back a few inches—not out of fear of the boy, but from the sudden return of brutality after such a surreal stillness. "Okay, whoa... I don't know what he was about to do, but kicking a dead body won't help you feel better," Tatl said, hovering cautiously, her usual snark blunted by the weight of what had just happened. Her glow remained dimmer than usual, as if reflecting the lingering shock in the air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhhh... you’re welcome," I murmured, uncertain, eyes still locked on the smoking remains of my enemy. "I didn’t mean to kill him though. I just wanted to scare him off..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Don’t you dare regret it," the boy growled, voice suddenly hard and steady, though his hands trembled. "This guy was... not human. He was a monster. They all were."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">His fists clenched, knuckles white with rage and memory. He shook from the weight of it, then exhaled long and slow—as if purging poison from his lungs. And then, as if drawn by some instinctual pull, his eyes landed on the glimmering blue bow slung over my shoulder. </span>
      <span class="c0">For a moment, all the pain slipped from his face, replaced by something raw and reverent. A flicker of awe, like he'd just seen magic for the first time—and couldn't quite believe it saved him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So... I haven't really seen you around? We usually catch wind pretty quick of strangers with magical weapons." The boy stepped forward, wiping the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand. His lank black hair fell across his brow. He was maybe a few inches taller than me in my current form, with a wiry, restless energy behind his dark eyes. He extended a scraped, calloused hand, muscles thin but coiled like a street cat ready to bolt or pounce. "Name's Ratt."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Umm... Link," I replied, giving his hand a light shake. His palm was rough with dirt and old scars.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Huh? Really? Weird name for a girl—but kinda awesome. Like, 'stick-it-to-em' awesome."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Why does everyone say that? What's wrong with my name?" I sighed, sharper than I meant to.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh! I didn't mean it like that! Just... sounds bold, y'know? Like something you'd shout from a rooftop." Ratt rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. "So, uh... where are you two headed?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl finally piped up, snapping out of her stunned silence. "We're going to the swamp. And we're outta time to talk about it—it's already three thirty, according to the Clock Tower!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The sunlight had thinned into amber veins across the alley walls, casting long, slanted shadows through the grime. A breeze pushed the stench of mildew and fried oil past us, and the murmur of distant bells reminded me how little time we had.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"The swamp? Seriously? You know there's a monster out there poisoning everything, right? People go in and they don’t come out."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah, we heard something like that. But we’ve got our reasons." I turned on my heel, cloak whipping behind me. "Thanks again... and stay out of trouble."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">As I turned, my cloak shifted and revealed the Hero’s Mask at my hip.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Whoa! That mask is awesome! Looks all brave and fierce and stuff! Where’d you get it? I've never seen anything like that. Bet if I had one, even the worst creeps around here wouldn’t mess with me anymore."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"It's... special," I muttered, tucking the fabric back into place over my mask. "One of a kind. I seriously doubt there's another like it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">He stared at me a beat longer, something unreadable in his eyes. Not envy—more like yearning</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well, I gotta say, you'd look way more intimidating with it on. I would’ve never guessed you were that tough, just from looking. You’re so small, kinda frail-looking... and well, really pretty. Like, goddess-tier pretty."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">His words stumbled out like loose pebbles—awkward, too loud, clearly unrehearsed. He blushed the moment they left his mouth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I shot him a glare, then turned away and kept walking, jaw tight.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey, wait—that was a compliment! You don’t like compliments or something?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Look, kid. I'm busy. You're welcome and all for me saving you, but I've got a lot to do. You can't follow me where I’m going. And no, I’m not much for being called pretty. So just... go away, okay?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Sheesh, you’re one weird chick, you know that?" he called after me, trying to laugh it off. "And who are you calling kid? You don’t look any older than me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I tried to ignore him and picked up my pace, weaving through the dusty side street. But the persistent idiot kept stride with me, undeterred</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"So..uhh... look, I'm part of this group, right? We call ourselves the Bombers, and we go around trying to help people, too." Ratt awkwardly massaged his neck as he prattled on. "Maybe I can pull some strings and, you know, get you a membership?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I sighed, putting a hand on my face while Tatl chuckled. "Looks like you have an admirer, hehe!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I took a swat at the precocious fairy, who dodged by increasing her altitude and continued giggling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"We don’t have time for this," I growled. "You can’t follow me, Ratt. It’s too dangerous, and you’ll just get in the way. I don’t need help, and I’m not joining your club. Got it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ya know what? I like your style, Link. Tough, relentless, stone-cold. Hah! I dig that."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I stopped in my tracks, exasperated, and turned to face him fully, hands planted firmly on my hips.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Leave me alone! Just because I saved your life doesn't mean you're invited to tag along. Don't you have somewhere to be right now? Like your secret sewer club hideout?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Ratt froze mid-step. "Wait... how’d you know about our hideout?" He leaned in, wide-eyed, lowering his voice like he was sharing a royal secret. "No one's supposed to know but us Bombers. That’s, like, rule number one."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">That did it. I snapped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You mean the place under the Star Chamber with the old ladder, the smell of moldy laundry, and rats the size of Cuccos guarding your stash of candy bars?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Ratt's jaw dropped. His expression flickered from horror to amazement, then landed squarely on adoration.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Whoa! You're like one of those legendary garo scouts from Ikana!! Jim’s gonna lose his </span>
      <span class="c4">mind </span>
      <span class="c0">when I tell him about you!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I groaned and rubbed my temples, already regretting engaging.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"I mean, you just—you show up, save my life, humiliate the Blood Wolves, shoot magic arrows, and now you know our hideout? Who </span>
      <span class="c4">are</span>
      <span class="c0"> you? Like, were you trained by secret royal warriors or something??"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Before I could protest or escape, Ratt zipped forward like a blushing hurricane and planted a quick, awkward kiss on my cheek.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I blinked, stunned. The world tilted. Heat surged up my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My fingers curled instinctively around my bow as he bolted, laughing like a boy who'd outrun fate. In one smooth, furious motion, I yanked it free, drew, and let a bolt of radiant magic shriek past his heels. The flash popped against the cobblestones, and Ratt yelped like a kicked Cucco, vaulting into the air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Oooh, </span>
      <span class="c4">feisty</span>
      <span class="c7 c6">! I </span>
      <span class="c4">love</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> that!" he crowed, already disappearing around the corner, laughter trailing behind him. Somewhere in the distance, I could just make out, "</span>
      <span class="c4">I'm totally in love with you!</span>
      <span class="c0">"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Hahaha! He got you </span>
      <span class="c4">so</span>
      <span class="c0"> good!" Tatl cackled, spinning in place. "You should’ve seen your face!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Seriously, Tatl?" I snarled, still fuming. "Can we </span>
      <span class="c4">not</span>
      <span class="c0"> do this right now?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Aww, come </span>
      <span class="c4">on</span>
      <span class="c0">!" she wheezed. "That was hilarious. Admit it. Just a little bit."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No. It wasn't. I'm still a guy, remember? I just—" I faltered, voice tight. "I just killed someone, Tatl. And you're out here laughing like it was some kind of carnival stunt."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl’s laughter faded, her wings drooping a little as she floated nearer. "Hey... I know. I just—Ratt caught us off guard, and I guess I needed the tension break. But you did good, Link. You helped that kid. That’s what the Mask Salesman meant, right? Healing the hurt in this world. You did that today."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I let out a bitter huff. "Whether I helped or not, we’re wasting time. You wanna crack jokes, go join the jugglers. Otherwise, point the way."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Okay, okay! You big sourpuss!" she said, offering a half-smile as she zipped ahead. "Southside’s just this way. Try not to melt before we get there."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She flitted down the walkway, back toward the main road. I stared after her a beat, then sighed and followed. The air felt heavier now— from everything that had happened. The swamp still lay ahead, probably a day’s journey at least. And we were already behind. There was too much to do… and not enough time to do it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Suddenly an idea popped into my mind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Wait, that's it! If the Ocarina can control Time, then maybe I could use it to keep time from moving too quickly!" I quietly reasoned, eyes widening with sudden inspiration.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Tatl! Hang on, I just thought of something!" I called out to the pixie flying just up ahead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"But, I thought we were in a hurry? Make up your mind!" Tatl scolded, her wings fluttering with irritation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Look." I produced the shimmering blue instrument from my belt pouch, the metal accents cool against my fingertips. "If we could turn it back with this, maybe we could slow time down as well?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"How? Is there another special song you know that can do that?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hmmm... no. Not really anything specific to stopping time, unless..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I gently raised the Ocarina to my lips, the sun catching its curves with a soft gleam. As I blew the first notes of the Song of Time, the air around us shifted. The melody drifted through the streets like wind through chimes, ethereal and slow, curling through the bustle of the plaza. A hush seemed to fall—briefly—as if the world leaned in to listen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A few of the common townsfolk stopped in their tracks, gazes drawn toward me with mild curiosity, some swaying unconsciously to the haunting cadence. Each note shimmered in the space between seconds, stretching them out, warping the edges of time itself. I focused all my will on the intention: not to reverse time, but to stretch it—to slow its river to a crawl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As the final note faded, I held my breath. The onlookers blinked and slowly returned to their business. The moment passed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl hovered beside me, watching the scene with narrowed eyes. After a beat, she shrugged. "Well... did it work?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I looked around, scanning for anything out of place. The crowd still bustled, voices rose and fell, merchants hawked their wares with the same fervor as before. The same elderly man leaned over his rickety cart, still bartering over...questionable apples. Nothing had changed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well, it was worth a shot," Tatl said with a halfhearted flap of her wings. "If anything, it's a pretty neat song. But c'mon, let's go. It shouldn't be too much longer to the southern gate."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Alright," I murmured, sliding the Ocarina back into my pouch. Yet something tugged at the edge of my senses.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The air felt just a little heavier, like the hush before a storm—or a moment caught in amber. But with the town still moving, it must have been my imagination. A single leaf detached from a nearby branch and hovered for an impossibly long moment before drifting slowly downward...maybe too slowly. But I didn't have time to think about it too long as Tatl was already on the move. I stepped after Tatl, trailing just behind her. With every footfall, the bustle of Clock Town seemed to peel away like a dream I was waking from. I was more eager than ever to leave it behind—to get away from the asinine guards, the aggravatingly flirtatious boys, the snide stares and suffocating streets.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Out there was the unknown—untamed, perilous, and free. A world of awe and danger and wild, uncharted possibilities. And for the first time in what felt like forever, my heart beat with something close to joy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Adventure. The exhilaration of the unknown.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Limitless possibilities awaited, and for once in a long time, I was truly in my element. </span>

    <p class="c39 title" id="h.kr1i20nkskim">
      <span class="c0">The blazing mid afternoon sun still shone high in the blue skies when we reached the old, eroded southern gate. The guard had discarded his visor, his sweat-slicked face weary beneath the sunlit blaze. He slouched against the chalky white limestone wall, brow furrowed as he wiped at the heat with little urgency. Around him, the southern commons simmered in slow decay...unkempt locals sprawled in the patchwork shade cast by leaning shanty roofs, waving scraps of paper or warped tin lids to stir the still air. Barefoot children darted between crumbling alleyways, their laughter sharp against the dusty silence, vanishing like mirages among weed-choked cracks in the pavement.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
      <span class="c7 c6">
        The heat clawed at my skin like invisible fingers, dragging sweat from every pore until my tunic clung to me like a soaked rag. It was hotter than it had been on that first day...oppressively so, like the sun itself was bearing down with the intent to set the world ablaze. My breath came shallow, fogging the air for just a heartbeat before the heat swallowed it whole. Behind me, Tatl fluttered low, her glow dulled to a wan shimmer. Even her voice...usually sharp and relentless, sounded slurred by the intense warmth.
        <br/>
      </span>
      <span>“</span>
      <span class="c0">Ughhh… why is it so hot?” she groaned, wings flitting uselessly. “This isn’t normal, Link. The sun… it hasn’t moved in hours.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
      <span>“</span>
      <span class="c0">Whew… I don’t know…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
      <span class="c0">I panted, brushing damp strands of hair from my forehead with the back of my hand. The heat pressed down like a weight, sticky and relentless.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
      <span>“</span>
      <span class="c0">What time is it, anyway?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
      <span class="c7 c6">
        Tatl hovered toward the towering spires of the Clock Tower, squinting through the shimmering heat haze that danced like water over the rooftops. Her glow pulsed faintly, flickering with uncertainty.
        <br/>
      </span>
      <span>“</span>
      <span class="c0">It’s… still only three-forty? That can’t be right. It feels like it’s been at least an hour since you rescued that kid!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
      <span class="c7 c6"> “Really?” I murmured, my voice low as I brushed damp bangs from my eyes. “You don’t think playing the Ocarina… </span>
      <span class="c4">did</span>
      <span class="c0"> something to time, do you?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
      <span class="c0">"Well...I dunno, you've got more experience with that thing. So you tell me?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
      <span class="c0">I observed the people around us. They all moved, talked, and played at a fairly normal pace. If the magical instrument had stopped time, I would only assume that the rest of the world would stop with it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
      <span class="c0">"Hmm...these people are all moving around, so I don't think time froze. Maybe you just saw the clock wrong earlier?" I deduced.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well, we were pretty distracted, especially you haha." Tatl winked at me as I glowered in response. "Oh come on, lighten up! The gate’s right there. We’ll figure it out soon enough."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I nodded to Tatl, her laughter picking up my spirits a bit, and looked to the gate. The guard was still bumbling around, now lazily playing catch with his helmet. He seemed oblivious of us. Still...without my mask, I doubted that I'd be allowed through. I gripped the wooden surface with clammy fingers from the belt, inspecting it closely to see if anything had changed. Something about it felt different now. As I lifted it in my hands, its surface shimmered faintly with vitality, almost alive.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'm going to try changing back," I told her, stepping toward an old crate beside a decaying home. "I've got a good feeling about the mask this time."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl hovered closer. "Good idea. I don’t feel like dealing with another idiot guard in this weather. I’m right behind you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I searched around the crate and house for any possible witnesses. Finding no one and satisfied we were alone, I took a deep breath and braced myself, bringing the mask to my face. I held back a muffled shriek as pain once more enveloped my body, and fought to stay on my feet. It wasn't as excruciating as before, but the heat of transformation still stole the breath from my lungs. Bones cracked and lengthened, my limbs shifting back into their taller, broader shape. I grunted, barely keeping on my feet. The familiar weight of gauntlets and boots returned.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Are you ok? Not going to pass out or anything, right?" Tatl voiced in concern.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Agh, no. I think..." I cleared my throat, startled by the suddenly deeper timbre. "I think I’ll be fine. That wasn’t so bad."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah well, could've fooled me, but I'd rather not try the experience myself."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Can’t blame you there." I stretched my arms and tested my balance, adjusting the chain-mail armor beneath the familiar green tunic. "But I’ll take transforming back into </span>
      <span class="c4">my</span>
      <span class="c0"> body over being a weak girl any day."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">After a similar assessment with my boots, I was satisfied that everything was in order. I made my way back to the limestone gates. The temperature seemed to rise with every passing minute, and the sun beat down fiercely upon me during the short walk. However, I wasn't worried about a little summer weather, and confidently strode up the aloof guard. The perspiring soldier appeared to be mildly dehydrated, but nodded to me as I closed in, waving us by with a dazed look in his eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yuh, you can go through. Be careful though...monsters...n' stuff..." He sighed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Uhhh, right. Thanks, I guess."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I returned his nod and plodded through the gate, heading beneath the thick wall. The shade did little to ease the heat, and my face was already beading with sweat. The weather was still manageable, though, and I'd been through much greater heat before. If the fires of Hyrule's great volcano Death Mountain couldn't conquer me, then a meager heatwave like this would be a cakewalk</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"So what's the plan, Mighty Hero?" Tatl flopped onto my shoulder with a groan.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"We get to the swamp, find whatever monster is plaguing the area, slice it to pieces, and dice any other beasts into slimy pulps. Then afterwards the locals say hooray and thank us, we move on to whatever else we need to do. Easy, simple, cut and dry." I wiped away a drop of sweat hanging down from my brow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, yes. Totally simple there, monster hunter...What a smart tactic... 'RAAUUGGHR LINK SMASH!'” Tatl sprawled onto my shoulder like a wet towel, “...we're gonna die..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I ignored her snark and continued out into the wide expanse of the flatlands before us. All the trees and foliage had been cut down and beaten back for almost a kilometer around the walls of Clock Town, leaving only fields of dry grass. The blue sky was bright and clear, with no clouds to block the harsh sun, nor wind to ease the soaring temperatures. The heat was finally starting to get to me, and I turned to Tatl in frustration.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Alright, Miss Critic, if you're finished roasting me, how about you stop using my shoulder as a free ride and tell me where we need to go?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh come on! I'm just joking, and your shoulder is comfy! But fine... just go past that hill with the Star Chamber. If I remember right, there should be a fork in the trail." The fairy thought for a moment. "I think the left path leads to a ranch, or farm... or something. Taking the right path takes you to the swamp, maybe..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Your confidence is almost overwhelming..." I scoffed, then rolled my eyes with a sigh. "Ughf...whatever. Let's just get there..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Aware that my mask's power wouldn't last long, I decided to run toward the copse of trees near the hill to save time. Tatl was caught off guard and tumbled off my shoulder as I lurched forward without warning. The parched grass crunched beneath my boots as I sprinted along. The disgruntled fairy fluttered after me, grumbling about being knocked off her comfy perch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Halfway to the trees, the earth suddenly shimmered, and two red, slimy Chuchus erupted from the ground in front of me. With a grin, I drew my sword and shield and waited for the monsters to make a move. They both wiggled in anticipation before leaping at me, the gelatinous bodies undulating as they moved. They lunged. I sidestepped and brought my sword down in one clean arc, bisecting them. Their jellied remains hit the dirt with a wet slap. Red goop splattered everywhere and bled out onto the thirsty earth, along with the liquefied remains of some poor fool's hand and torso.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ewwww that was...gross." Tatl retched as the ooze evaporated. "But uh...good job. Best not to end up like...ugh...that guy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That was nothing. If you want to see gross, you should go to Hyrule's graveyard."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I chuckled as I wiped red globules from my blade into the dry grass, watching the goopy remains quickly evaporate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Reanimated corpses, blood and gore, disembodied rotting skulls...you'd love it!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh gee, sounds like such a treat. Thanks but no thanks...blech!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I sheathed my sword behind me, and returned the Hylian shield to my back. Mirages danced along the horizon in the sweltering heat, and my face dripped with sweat onto my damp tunic. The air was deathly still, without even a gasp of wind to alleviate the scorched earth. I looked to the skies, where the sun remained in the same position when we l town.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well, the sun still hasn't moved. I think the Ocarina actually stopped time!" I marveled to Tatl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Greeeaaaat...can you play it again? If it gets any hotter, and I think I'll literally combust." Tatl groaned as she fanned herself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah, I might as well. Hang on..." I nodded and went for my Ocarina.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I reached into the respective belt pouch, but came up empty handed. Figuring that I had unconsciously moved to a different one, I shrugged and felt around the other pouches. Still unable to find the Ocarina, I frantically searched along the ground to see if I somehow dropped it! The blue instrument was nowhere to be seen!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What's wrong?" Tatl noticed the panic in my eyes. "You didn't lose it did you? Oh gods, please tell me you didn't!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No! I always put it right back in this pouch here!" I pointed to the rear pouch. "But it's not there!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well...we're doomed. Between the sun broiling everything alive, and the moon falling. Yeah, this world is toast! Or jelly, depending on what happens first."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"This is no time for your jokes!" I bellowed, the fairy flinched at my booming voice. "If we don't find that Ocarina, we're all doomed!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok ok, GEEZ!" Tatl muttered defensively. "Just calm down, take a breath, and think. Surely no one stole it from you. What could have possibly happened to it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I took a deep breath and roughly massaged my temples. I winced as I felt the second skin almost tear away and I pushed my palms against it, keeping it in place.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"I hate this thing. I can't even </span>
      <span class="c4">think </span>
      <span class="c0">properly without it falling off!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Wait... Link, that's it! The mask!" Tatl chimed. "It's a complete magical change, so maybe it totally alters your gear, as well as your clothes and weapons!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"So... What you're saying is that I can only play my Ocarina without my mask? Only as a blasted idiot girl?!" I growled, the heat of the sun making my anger worse.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Apparently! Now calm down! It's not such a bad thing, and it could always be worse!" Tatl chided, wagging her tiny fingers at me. "I've seen the Skull Kid tear things apart with his mind, and explode people from the inside out. It's a wonder you're even alive after both failed encounters. Now take off the mask and play your flute thing! This heat is making me crazy!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I scowled at the pixie, seething that she was probably right, and hissed a response through my teeth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Fine...stupid fairy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I hesitated for a moment, then reached for the mask, bracing myself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">The transformation back hit fast, a torrent of twisting, tightening, </span>
      <span class="c4">shrinking</span>
      <span class="c0">. I clenched my teeth as my limbs reformed, my clothes shifting around a suddenly unfamiliar body. When it passed, I gasped for breath...lighter, smaller, back to this stupid form.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"There...*huff*... happy now?" I gasped at the fairy as the shifting finished.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yes...sort of. Now can you hurry?" Tatl replied.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I rolled my eyes at the fairy, watching my crimson locks sway as I reached into the pouch behind the restored cloak. Sure enough, the Ocarina was resting within. I gripped the instrument and pulled it to my face, pursing my lips. The Ocarina once more echoed throughout the area as I played the Song of Time. I focused my thoughts towards time flowing normally. The final notes echoed across the fields. A breeze stirred. And the world shivered around us as the cool air seemed to refresh the lands again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well...you were right after all, Tatl.” I sighed, “I can only use the Ocarina in this body. Wonderful...."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As I returned the instrument to my belt, the sun began to quickly retreat down to the horizon. As if it were attempting to restore itself within the present. The cool breeze suddenly became freezing gusts, and then mighty gales which knocked me to the ground. Tatl gripped onto my bow for dear life as I desperately tried to keep from blowing away as a frozen icicle. As quick as it started, the tempest suddenly ceased and the world once again became silent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Umm...what just happened?" Tatl hovered, flabbergasted at the now-dark sky.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I think that was time catching up to itself. So much for trying to get ahead... I hope we bought ourselves a little more at least." I gasped and stood up, brushing away frozen sweat and dust room my face and clothing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I dunno, but I'm sure everyone is freaking out right now. Between the moon, the sun, and crazy wind, I think I'd have gone bonkers if I didn't already know what was going on!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Me, too. Maybe we shouldn't stop time again. It might be worse than just heat and wind next time. Oh, and umm...sorry for snapping at you earlier...I didn't mean it. The sun was probably affecting my mood."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Yeah, you better be sorry!" Tatl smirked. "If it happens again, I'll have to tear </span>
      <span class="c4">you </span>
      <span class="c0">to pieces, wahaha!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh I don't doubt it, Mighty Tatl, great fairy warrior!" I stated in mock reverence. "May great destruction reign down upon those tiny flies that dare to challenge you!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok, ok... let's get moving before you break a nail or something."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ha! You know you really do belong on a stage, entertaining everyone with such hilarious jokes."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I shook my head as Tatl giggled with soft chimes, and resumed the trek toward the copse of trees near the Star Chamber ahead. We moved quickly as the sun set, and soon reached the first few trees. I slowed, and listened carefully for monsters lying in wait. I lightly stepped underneath the canopy, and into the shadows. Thankfully, the going was easy since the ground was solid now, not the sludgy muck it was last time we came through the area. Flitting my gaze around as I walked with my bow at the ready, I asked the glimmering fairy flying over my shoulder where the path was.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You just have to keep going further in, it should be to the right of that slope up ahead." She whispered, hovering next to my ear.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I nodded and adjusted course. I heard leaves rustling above and aimed up at the sound. Two pairs of glowing red eyes swooped down, coming straight for us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The black bats' leathery wings were huge, ending in ferocious claws. They came at us, screeching loudly with large fangs protruding from their open maws. My nimble fingers, now more familiar with the bow, expertly loosed two magic bolts at the Bad Bats. The arrows hit their targets dead on, and the winged monsters flopped clumsily to the ground, their heads replaced by sizzling holes. I swiveled my head, ensuring that no others had joined in the assault.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Do you see any more?" I asked the anxious pixie.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl looked all around. "I think we're safe for now. I don't hear anything else."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I hastened my steps onward. We quickly moved around the slope ahead, and sure enough discovered a well- beaten path of gravel and dirt. I paused on the road, trying to figure out which way to go. One direction curved east, leading out of the forest and likely toward town. The other way went south, around the hill. Tatl tugged on my cloak, pulling me in the southern direction.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"C'mon, keep moving before more monsters find us!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey, I can move on my own, you know?" I berated. "Ease up on the pulling!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The rushed fairy released the fabric and flew to my ear.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok, well the swamp isn't far from here. If we hurry we can get there before sunrise...-"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl was cut off when we both heard a loud rumbling up ahead. We both turned to see a white cart coming into view as it rounded the hill, drawn by strongly built horses. I say that the driver was a lanky, shirtless man with a straw hat and tanned leather chaps. Not wanting to draw extra attention, we dashed to the side of the road and hid behind one of the tree trunks. I didn't want to be delayed any longer, especially by yet another violent encounter should the driver prove to be hostile. Tatl ducked underneath my cloak to hide her luminous form standing out in the twilight.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The horses slowed as they passed on by, but the cart stopped right next to our tree with the driver pulling on the reins with a shout.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ya'll out there hiding in the woods better come out now, 'afore I blow ya to kingdom come!" The driver shouted in a country twang, not unlike Talon from Lon Lon Ranch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I slowly peeked around the trunk, while silently preparing another magic arrow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah, I sees ya! This ain't my first rodeo now, git on out in the open!" The rough man produced a bomb, and readied a match to light it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok ok!" I reslung my bow and stepped away from the tree. "Just put that away before you kill all of us!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Where's yer friend? The shiny one?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl reluctantly flew out of cover, grumbling, sharing my irritation at the delay.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Now, ya'll tell me if there are any more of you, or we all go kablooey! I ain't lettin' no bandits steal our milk this time!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The man inched the lit match toward the fuse. Determination shone in his eyes, as the fire danced shadows along his features.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, wait, there are only two of us! We're just trying to make our way to the swamp, now relax and put that thing away!" I snapped. The man paused, then relented, puffing out the tiny flame.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hoo wee...this day's just a'goin all kinds of cracked! You tellin me tiny things like ya'll headed for the swamp? Must be crazier than a croc... but between that moon, the sun, and all around weather, I' bound to believe anythin' at this point." The wiry driver scratched his chin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ummm right. Well, we must be off now. Farewell!" I waved as we scooted past the cart and the still confused man.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Now now, Missy, you can't be serious about going there! The swamp'll eat you alive, I tell ya! And the deku scrubs are like to capture you two for trespassing! They been actin' real strange. Everything's been goin' kooky since that moon grew a face. These are the end times I tell ya!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Exactly, so we have to go before it's too late!" Tatl flew up to the man's tanned, scraggly face. "There's no time for us to chit chat! Especially with your poor grasp of language."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Shooty dawg if you ain't a cranky one....Yipes!” The man waved Tatl away with a surprised yelp, “Fine fine! I gotta get these supplies to town anyways a'fore I run into any more trouble. Good luck to ya'll! Oh, and I reckon if ya'll change your mind, my ranch is right up th' road if ya need a place to stay the night!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The man shucked his reins and the horse-drawn cart creaked along as bottles clanged together in the back of the wagon. I heard him distantly mumble something about 'crazy fillies' and 'everything running amuck' as the cart vanished from view behind the trees. Tatl and I shrugged to each other and took off running around the bend where the cart came from.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A few thin trees rested beside the path as we passed the hill, but the sky was clearly visible and stars twinkled peacefully in the night sky above. The moon was larger now, with its gravely visage piercing down upon the world in silent malice. I shivered; the face of the cursed satellite gave me chills. It served as an ever-looming reminder of why I was here, what inevitable doom was coming if I failed. But I pressed onward, intent on saving this world. That was what I was made for, even if I lost my old body.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">An hour passed by as we followed the trail, and I fought to keep my eyes open. I hadn't had any sleep yet, and the constant action of these past few days had worn away the Great Fairy's vigor that was given to me. I wasn't the only one struggling though.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'm getting tired, Link... we should stop somewhere and make camp." Tatl loudly yawned and plopped onto my shoulder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, we need to..." I yawned after the fairy, releasing a sleepy squeak. I cleared my throat and continued, shaking myself awake. "Aherm, we need to keep moving... "</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Aww, see? You're just as exhausted as me." Tatl expressed, rubbing her eyes. "Can we at least stop for a small nap?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No..." I huffed. "Look, we're almost there. The road splits up ahead!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The path diverged right and left. A broken signpost sat between the road, the split pieces on the ground had the letters "Swa " and "Ranch" painted on them, but gave no clear direction.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Umm...you said go right, yeah?" I questioned Tatl, who was quickly falling asleep.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah...right..." The drowsy pixie repeated.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I plodded to the right, shuffling my feet through the dirt. A nap did sound nice, and I seriously considered it while my feet ambled further down the road. As I debated with myself, a bright ball of light flashed by in the night sky, moving far too erratically to be a shooting star or comet, making an infernal screeching noise. I turned to the sleeping fairy on my shoulder and nudged her awake with my bare finger.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey, wake up." I whispered. "Is that type of thing normal out here?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The bright orb darted down the road away from us, and Tatl squinted after it and opened her eyes wide.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Uhhh no. Not at all! What is that thing?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'm not sure, but I've got a bad feeling about it. I've never seen anything like it before. Maybe we should umm...go the other way. Sleeping until dawn at that ranch, or whatever you said it was, doesn't seem like such a bad idea!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I felt goosebumps rise along my arms, and quivered from the chilling sound the thing produced as it followed the trail. Tatl, fully awake now, nodded and drifted off of my shoulder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I think that you might be right. I'm super creeped out...so...let's go before it comes back!" Tatl twinkled in fright, fairy dust falling to the ground as she shivered as well.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl and I turned around, and fled to follow the other road opposite the ranch. Only after I was certain that the thing wasn't coming for us, did I slow down, taking deep breaths to calm my nerves. Tatl looked worriedly behind us, but was relieved to learn that the thing had ignored us. I took in the surroundings, checking for any other new threats. Trees were plentiful down this way, and the air was thick with moisture, carrying with it a foul stench.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"So, this path looks, and smells, more...swampy than the other. I think we're headed in the right direction." I said to Tatl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"It's been awhile since I've been down this way. The swamp is not the most pleasant of places so I try to avoid it. Before we go any further though...I think we should sleep. It only gets worse from here.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah...you're probably right. We can find somewhere safe to take a short nap I guess." I mumbled while rubbing my eyes. "I doubt I'd be able to save anything if I collapse from exhaustion..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl nodded, and I sluggishly glanced around the trail for a nook or cranny to tuck into. The damp ground surrounding us was a definite no, but the thick branches high on the trees above looked promising. A short climb should be easy, so I veered toward the next trunk and began shimmying up the bark.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Come on, ugh... we'll be relatively safe up here." I grunted as I scrambled up to the largest branch, and wedged myself between it and the trunk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Whatever you say, as long as I can snooze in peace." The fairy yawned.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl nestled herself in my warm cloak, chiming in comfort as she got settled. I was too sleepy to mind, and it wasn't long at all before we both drifted to sleep. The crickets chirped and all manner of nocturnal animals yipped and squawked, serving as a natural lullaby. I quickly forgot about the ball of fire, and allowed my eyes to relax shut, falling almost immediately into a dreamless sleep.</span>

    <h1 class="c13" id="h.abzqj2tblm9h">
      <span class="c9 c16 c8 c18">The Southern Swamp</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">I awoke with a start as something small and solid pelted my knee. Almost tumbling from the high branch, I caught myself just in time to see two odd, hairy creatures fleeing down the road on all fours. A grumpy Tatl protested my sudden movements and flopped out of the green cloak in a tangled mess.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What's the big idea?" the fairy whined. "Why are we waking up so early? The sun's only just beginning to rise! And I was having such a great dream too…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Calm down, I was woken by some hairy beasts throwing stuff at me…" I shushed, staring after the creatures.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A red sun was peeking just over the hills to the east, indicating a storm like before. Looming grey clouds moved in from the north, and damp wind lightly brushed my hair.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Great. More rain…" I stood and stretched my arms and legs. "Ok, I guess that's as good a wake-up call as anything. Better get moving before the storm washes us away, Tatl."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I knelt down, grabbing hold of the gnarled branch beneath me, and gracefully swung away from the branch. Rolling mid-air, I landed squarely on the path with an agile twist. I was suddenly very grateful for the new supporting undergarments—the jolt of the landing would’ve been brutal on my chest without them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Nice...maybe you belong in the circus, too." Tatl flew down beside me. "I almost guarantee that you couldn't do that in your old body!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hmm, probably not. Maybe this form isn't so useless after all." I cracked a small grin and peered down the path. "Wait... look over there! Those are the things that attacked me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The furry white beasts stood still and faced us, almost like they were waiting. Their large eyes glimmered curiously, and flared upturned, wide nostrils on their leathery, grey faces.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, monkeys? They don't really attack people, they're mostly just annoying." Tatl replied nonchalantly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Wha? What's a monkey? We don't have any of those in Hyrule."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Those animals right there, like I said! Monkeys live in a giant tree within the swamp and are friendly enough, but can be pretty mischievous. I've never heard of them coming out this far though… it's odd for them to wander from their home tree."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well, they seem to be waiting for me. If they are friendly, do you think we should follow them?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"They are heading in the direction of the swamp, so I don't see any reason not to." The pixie shrugged. "But be on your guard, who knows what waits ahead."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I nodded and stepped toward the monkeys, who immediately burst into motion—jumping excitedly, clapping their hands with rapid, rhythmic slaps, then dashing down the dirt road in a flurry of scampering limbs. Their shrill chattering and the soft thump of padded feet against the muddy path echoed through the morning hush, beckoning us to follow with an almost gleeful urgency.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A fine drizzle began to fall from the bruised sky, each droplet ticking softly against leaves and soil as we neared the trail’s end. The sound mingled with the rustle of wind in the branches above, whispering a quiet warning of the storm to come. The monkeys scrambled up some trees that lined the edge of a foul, murky bog, as if marking the threshold between the familiar trail and the swamp’s shadowy heart. A powerful stench permeated the humid air, and a thin mist swirled along the damp, mossy ground. Croaks and growls from swamp creatures resounded all around us, including what sounded like wolfos calls. Large tree trunks supported a wide canopy over the tepid, algae-crusted waters, with vines hanging down various branches. The monkeys took hold of the vines and swung away into the fog.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Umm...ok? Now what? They can't expect us to follow them like that!" I looked to Tatl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I dunno...monkeys are weird. But there's a boat rental shop not far from here, according to that sign. It looks like it's pointing down the shoreline that way." She pointed a tiny arm to a signpost nailed to a tree.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Good, a boat would be helpful. I'd rather not have to swim through this stuff. The smell alone might kill me!" I reeled away from the squalid bog.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl fluttered down a somewhat obscure pathway through the mire, her glow muted beneath the thick canopy and the ever-churning mists. I chased after her, hair clinging to my cheeks in the warm humidity, my boots sinking into the spongy moss and muck. The air was pungent with rot, the distant croak of frogs and whisper of unseen things all around us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I caught up just as she froze midair, wings humming with tension. She stared ahead, and I followed her gaze—only to find three grey wolfos hunched over a fallen monkey, their blood-slick muzzles tearing at limp limbs. The sound of crunching bone was too loud.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I motioned quietly to Tatl to back away, my heart thudding in my throat—but it was too late. One of the wolves, its snout matted with gore, snapped its head up. Its green eyes glowed like twin curses. With a savage snarl, it howled—a battle cry that sent the others whipping around, their mouths dripping thick threads of saliva.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I fumbled for my bow and fired a trio of radiant arrows. They struck with sharp flashes—but bounced off, fizzing out harmlessly into mist.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Damn it!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The alpha lowered its head and charged.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I shoved the bow aside and reached for the Hero's Mask beneath my cloak. My fingers trembled—just for a moment—as they closed around its smooth, too-familiar shape. It pulsed faintly, like it had been waiting. Like it remembered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I slammed it onto my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The shift was violent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Muscle coiled and hardened through my limbs. My ribs compressed as a deeper breath filled new lungs. My bones ached, grinding into place as the mask fused with me. Confidence bloomed—hot and overwhelming—as my senses sharpened and something primal took the wheel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">By the time the wolfos reached me, I was already moving.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My shield rose instinctively, steel ringing against claw. I shoved the beast back hard, feeling its weight give beneath my strength. My sword slid free, eager in my hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Come on then," I growled, a crooked smirk tugging at the corners of my mouth. My voice sounded deeper now—rougher, edged with something hungry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl retreated to the treetops with a worried trill, her glow flickering with unease.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The other two wolves circled, hackles raised, low snarls vibrating the air between us. The alpha lunged again, a blur of grey muscle and fury.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I spun into its charge, steel flashing. My blade met its claws in a spray of sparks, and I twisted, dancing just out of reach as the beast stumbled past. The movement felt effortless—almost playful. I laughed, a low, taunting sound that didn’t quite feel like mine.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Too slow," I hissed, savoring the moment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The wolfos staggered, its flank wide open. The scent of blood was thick in the air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">With a single, brutal thrust, I drove my sword into the soft flesh beneath its ribs. The creature howled—a short, sharp cry—before collapsing into the mud, its limbs spasming in death.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I yanked the blade free, flicking blood into the black water.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"One down," I murmured, letting the words hang like a challenge. "Who's next?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The others lunged at once—claws slicing the air—and I backflipped, landing light on my feet in the mire with a muddy splash. My blood roared. Every heartbeat thudded like war drums in my chest. A plan burned in my mind: bait them into a tree and strike when they were stuck.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I slammed my shield with the hilt of my sword, the clang echoing through the swamp like a bell of war. I grinned—savage, wild—as I backed toward the largest trunk I could find. The wolves took the bait.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Three snarling beasts surged at me, eyes alight with bloodlust. My back struck bark. They thought I was cornered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Perfect.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I dropped low, rolled, and their claws raked empty air inches above my head. Bark splintered behind me as their talons buried into the trunk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I didn’t even rise—I spun from the crouch, blade extended, a perfect arc of wrath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Steel sang. Bodies buckled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My sword carved through ribs and muscle with a wet, sickening cleave, the howl of one wolf cut short in a bubbling gasp. A geyser of black blood burst from its throat, drenching my tunic and hissing where it hit the magic-etched steel. Gods I loved this sword!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Another wolf twisted, impaled mid-leap, its momentum carrying it down the length of my blade until I shoved it off with a boot to its chest. Bone cracked beneath my heel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The last one barely had time to flinch. I pivoted, snarling, and split it from jaw to sternum in one downward stroke. The flesh parted like overripe fruit, spraying gore across the roots.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Their lifeless corpses hung grotesquely from the bark, claws still buried deep, as if frozen mid-hunt. The air reeked of iron and rot.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stood slowly, chest heaving, the thrill still burning hot in my lungs—and laughed. It wasn't relief. It wasn't joy. It was wild and sharp, a sound that didn’t belong in the throat of a child. Loud, long, unrepentant. It echoed through the swamp like a dare—like I was begging the world to send me more.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">This... this was what I was made for.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The blood, the precision, the raw satisfaction of dominance. It had been too long.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Too long since I felt </span>
      <span class="c4">alive</span>
      <span class="c0"> like this.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I wiped the ichor from my blade with the sole of my boot, watching the thick smear slide across the steel. Something deep inside me thrilled at the mess, at the power. And for a moment... I didn’t care who I had to become to keep feeling this way.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That was incredible! How'd you do that?" Tatl praised, flitting down to eye level, her light flickering with hesitant awe.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Experience," I said, my voice husky with adrenaline. "I’ve fought worse. Wolfos are nothing compared to what I’ve survived."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stalked past the corpses without looking back, like they were already fading into memory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well, I bet if Skull Kid saw you do that, he'd think twice before messing with you again, haha!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"He caught me off guard," I muttered. My hands twitched at my sides. "But I wasn’t expecting such power from a simple skull child. Next time, the imp won’t be so lucky."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl hovered awkwardly. "Uhhh, right. We should keep moving though, it's creepy around here…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What? Did I say something wrong?" I snapped, quicker than I meant to, the fight still sizzling under my skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, we just uhh... need to hurry…" she said, shrinking from me, her glow dimming.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok...fine. Be that way," I muttered, forcing my breathing to slow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl stopped suddenly, wings still.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"It’s just... you get so worked up about killing Skull Kid. He used to be your friend, remember? And... I dunno. Sometimes it sounds like you </span>
      <span class="c4">enjoy</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> it. The violence. Like you </span>
      <span class="c4">want</span>
      <span class="c0"> it, when you wear your mask…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Her voice was soft, but it cut deep. And for a second, I couldn’t tell if I was angry because she was wrong—or because she wasn’t.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I stared ahead into the mist, her words echoing longer than they should’ve. Was I really that bloodthirsty now? That wasn’t me. That wasn’t </span>
      <span class="c4">supposed</span>
      <span class="c0"> to be me. I only fought when I had to—only when there was no other choice. But the heat in my blood… it hadn't felt like necessity. It had felt like hunger.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I turned to her, slowly. “Does it really look that way to you?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">“Yeah, it does. It’s kinda scary, to be honest,” Tatl replied, her voice quiet but steady. “And you only act that way when you wear the mask. Without it, you’re calmer. Softer. Like yourself again. I dunno…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">“Huh…” I looked down at the gauntlet on my hand, at how the metal gleamed like it belonged there. “Maybe this form is getting to my head.” I flexed my fingers, half expecting to feel claws instead of skin. “Or maybe… maybe I’m getting too comfortable in someone else’s skin.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">“We can ask the salesman,” she offered. “When this is over. He might know more about it.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I hesitated. The power still coursed through me. I didn’t </span>
      <span class="c4">want</span>
      <span class="c0"> to let it go. But her eyes held no fear—just concern. Real concern. And that pierced deeper than her words had.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">“Yeah… better save the magic anyway,” I mumbled, forcing a half-smile. “No sense burning it all now. As much as I… want to stay like this.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I paused, glancing down at my hands again. “Tatl… what if I’m changing? Not just the body—me. What if the mask is starting to rewrite who I am?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She hovered closer. “I don’t think it’s rewriting you. But maybe… it’s amplifying something. Drawing out parts of you that you try to keep buried.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I swallowed. “But what if those parts take over?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">“They won’t,” she said gently. “Because you’re scared of that. And the fact that you’re scared means you’re still in control.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">With a slow breath, I reached up and peeled the mask away. It came off reluctantly, like it had grown roots in my skin. As it separated, I felt a strange tug in my chest—like something tearing loose from inside. Then the shift began.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">It was never graceful.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My shoulders cracked inward, collarbones narrowing. Muscle retreated down my limbs like the tide, leaving me smaller, lighter, softer. My hands trembled as calluses vanished, replaced by thinner fingers that no longer fit the gauntlets quite right. The armor sagged on me—suffocating and oversized, pressing down on shrinking bones with the weight of someone I no longer was. I staggered under it, each step an effort, until the enchantment caught up and the fabric of my clothes adjusted with a faint shimmer. The mail tightened, resizing, reshaping—but not before I felt that moment of utter helplessness, like drowning in the remains of someone else’s body. I stumbled, breath hitching as my center of gravity shifted, hips subtly widening, my chest compressing and rising in uneven spasms as it adjusted to a new rhythm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My voice, when it finally escaped in a ragged breath, was higher again. Familiar. Unfamiliar.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">The worst part was... I was starting to </span>
      <span class="c4 c12">get used to it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Not just the pain, but the shape. The lightness. The way the world looked from here.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And that terrified me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl floated close and rested a tiny hand against my shoulder. “We’ll figure it out, okay? You’re just… adjusting. Swapping bodies like that—no one could do it perfectly. Not even you.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Her glow pressed gently into my shoulder—not heat, not light, but something else. Like the memory of a hand I hadn’t held in years.. It surprised me—how gentle she was being, how much she </span>
      <span class="c4">cared</span>
      <span class="c0">. Tatl had always been sharp-tongued and fast to criticize, but there was something softer in her now, something she rarely let anyone see.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">And I felt it. I </span>
      <span class="c4">needed</span>
      <span class="c0"> it. That tiny hand on my shoulder was the only thing keeping the fear from swallowing me whole.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">“I don’t know who I’m becoming,” I whispered, feeling my hands tremble as they gripped the wood of my old self.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">“Maybe you don’t have to know yet,” she said. “Maybe it’s enough that you’re still </span>
      <span class="c4">trying</span>
      <span class="c0"> to be you.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I nodded, not trusting my voice, and tucked the mask away inside my cloak. Its weight felt heavier than before.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And we kept walking. Quietly. Just two souls in the mist, trying not to lose sight of who we were…trying not to think about who I was becoming.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Putting any further bleak thoughts aside, I concentrated on our surroundings. The stillness gnawed at me. The swamp had become deathly silent—no croaks, no wingbeats, not even the buzz of insects. The air grew colder, heavy like wet wool against my skin. Each step felt like it stirred ghosts beneath the mire.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Then I saw it. A thick wall of fog rolling in across the lagoon, not drifting but </span>
      <span class="c4">hunting</span>
      <span class="c0">. It pulsed with slow, unnatural rhythm, as if it were breathing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A chill lanced down my spine.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Tatl! TATL!" I hissed, trying to keep my voice low but urgent. "Get off the path! Something's coming from the swamp!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She turned, and the moment her eyes locked onto the approaching haze, her glow dimmed to a nervous flicker. We scrambled off the trail and ducked behind a clutch of enormous, slime-slick ferns. My heart thundered in my ears as we crouched low.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">The fog roiled like boiling tar, and then began to </span>
      <span class="c4">congeal</span>
      <span class="c7 c6">—not fade, not part, but </span>
      <span class="c4">thicken</span>
      <span class="c0">, pulling itself together as if it had a mind and malice of its own.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Then we heard it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A moan—not human, not beast. Long, hollow, and soaked in agony. It pierced the silence like a blade, sending ripples through the swampwater. Every instinct in me screamed to run.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The fog convulsed one final time before vomiting out a shape.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">It stumbled forward on two legs—barely. A towering, hunched figure cloaked in rotting swampmoss and tattered black fabric, parts of its flesh blistered and seamed like melted wax. Its face was hidden behind a cracked mask painted in crimson spirals, warped by moisture and time. Veins of shadow throbbed through its limbs, pulsing like worms beneath paper-thin skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">In one hand, it clutched a diamond-shaped shield crusted with dried blood and mold. In the other—a rusty, jagged sword, its edge curved like a butcher’s hook, pitted with decay. It dragged the blade along the muck as it moved, and the sound it made—metal on stone, on bone—rattled in my teeth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">It didn’t speak. It didn’t need to. Its presence alone suffocated the air, like a memory of death come walking.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Tatl pressed against my shoulder, trembling. "What... what </span>
      <span class="c4">is</span>
      <span class="c0"> that?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I didn't answer. I couldn't. My mouth had gone dry, my fingers twitching toward my mask.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Because whatever this thing was, I knew in my gut—we weren’t supposed to see it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And it wasn’t supposed to be awake.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl muffled a sharp cry at the ghastly creature's appearance. The brackish skin dangled in tattered shreds from rotting muscle tissue and bone, and a horrendous stench of death emitted from the body.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">The mask worn by the monster looked ancient—less like it had been crafted and more like it had </span>
      <span class="c4">grown</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> out of time itself. Its wooden surface was splintered with rot and age, warped by moisture, and painted with flaking white tribal patterns that writhed faintly in the shifting fog as though still alive. Three long, moss-streaked green pinions jutted from the crown of its head like the plumage of a diseased bird. The mask's gnarled eyes and mouth were hollow, bottomless voids that seemed to </span>
      <span class="c4">drink</span>
      <span class="c0"> the light around them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">From those gaping orifices dribbled a thick, purple-black ichor, syrupy and reeking of decay. It oozed down the warped mask and spattered onto the bog, hissing softly as it poisoned everything it touched.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The creature’s torso was a massacre of torn flesh. Great wounds split it open from sternum to navel, revealing necrotic organs sloshing wetly with each shambling step. Its intestines dangled like rotten vines, swinging against the remnants of shredded, ceremonial robes that clung to its form in tatters. Each moan that echoed from its throat was guttural—like something being dragged from the bottom of a grave.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Behind it, a slick trail of that noxious ichor bled into the swampwater, curling through it like ink in milk—clouding, poisoning, </span>
      <span class="c4">killing</span>
      <span class="c0">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The creature staggered deeper into the bog, dragging its sword like a reaper's scythe behind it. Only once it vanished into the veil of mist did the air begin to shift again. The fog clung like breath from a grave, curling around roots and stones with the hunger of something that remembered the living. The stench remained, but the pressure in my chest lifted, and I realized I’d been holding my breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl and I exhaled in unison.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ughhh... I guess we found our monster," I murmured, stepping slowly out of cover, every muscle still tight with dread. My voice sounded thin, stretched taut across the fear still clinging to my ribs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Yeah... let’s umm... </span>
      <span class="c4">not</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> go after it though," Tatl said, trying to sound flippant but failing. "That thing was terrifying! How could anything </span>
      <span class="c4">live</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> here with nightmares like </span>
      <span class="c4">that</span>
      <span class="c0"> lurking around!?" She gagged behind me, wings flickering erratically.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"We have to go after it," I said flatly, eyes still scanning the fading mist. "That’s the whole reason we’re here."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"But... did you </span>
      <span class="c4">see</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> it? That thing was </span>
      <span class="c4">HUGE!</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> It’s not just some common wolfos or chu-chu—its weapons were, like, twice your size! You’d be </span>
      <span class="c4">paste</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> before you even touched it! And it was already dead! How do you kill something that’s </span>
      <span class="c4">already</span>
      <span class="c0"> dead?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Trust me, I’ve fought bigger," I replied, more calm than I felt. "And undead aren’t the hardest to put down. They don’t think. They just follow pain. But that fog it seems to travel with... that’s the real problem. If we don’t track it to its lair, it could vanish again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Tatl buzzed beside me, fidgeting midair. "Seriously? You’re not even the </span>
      <span class="c4">tiniest</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> bit scared? That </span>
      <span class="c4">thing</span>
      <span class="c0"> will be starring in my nightmares for years!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I let out a breath, glancing back the way the monster had gone. "I’ve seen worse. Once, I had to descend into the Shadow Temple—an ancient burial vault beneath a graveyard. It wasn’t just ruins... it was a place of ritual torment. The walls were painted in dried blood, iron masks still nailed to the stone where the skeletal remains of prisoners had been bound. There were pits lined with spikes, corridors that whispered.... The dead didn’t just lie still down there—they </span>
      <span class="c4">waited</span>
      <span class="c0">. And don't even get me started about something called the Dead Hand..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Tatl’s glow pulsed nervously. "W-wait, what?! If that </span>
      <span class="c4">wasn’t</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> a blatant lie... how are you even still </span>
      <span class="c4">alive</span>
      <span class="c0">?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I shrugged, a bitter smile tugging at the edge of my mouth. "Courage. Luck. Or maybe just a magical sword that cut through evil monster souls like nothing."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">She hovered closer. "Let me guess... you </span>
      <span class="c4">conveniently</span>
      <span class="c0"> don’t have it anymore?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Returned it to its resting place," I said. "When my mission ended, there was no need to keep it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"No </span>
      <span class="c4">need</span>
      <span class="c7 c6">?!" she squeaked. "Did you </span>
      <span class="c4">see</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> that thing? We could’ve </span>
      <span class="c4">used</span>
      <span class="c0"> a soul-cleaving sword of destiny right about now!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah, well... life’s full of bad timing," I muttered, my hand drifting toward the mask hidden beneath my cloak. "We make do with what we have. I left Hyrule with a sword and shield that a temple priest had blessed to burn with divine light whenever it touched something truly evil but...well, it's probably gone forever."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The sword I carried now—when masked, anyway—wasn't quite the same. It had the right weight, and it sang a familiar note when I swung it, but there was something missing in the resonance. It felt hollow, like an echo of what it pretended to be. Not a legacy blade, not a weapon of destiny—just a shadow made steel. It moved like it remembered greatness but couldn’t quite reclaim it. As if it knew it was only wearing a hero… not living with one. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">The thought made my lips curl downward in anger at my fate. The memory of what I once carried—what I once </span>
      <span class="c4">was</span>
      <span class="c0">—sank like a stone in my chest. The world I left behind had crowned me a hero, but here I was, crawling through a haunted swamp with a false sword and a body that barely felt like mine. Every step forward felt like penance. Every breath was like a reminder that no prophecy had saved me from this. My destiny had turned to ash, and I was choking on the embers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl was quiet for a beat, then mumbled, "I still think you’re insane. But I guess that’s the only kind of person who’d walk into a swamp like this."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That makes two of us," I said, finally cracking a small smile.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She huffed. "Don’t remind me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I started down the trail again, anxious to leave the area.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Wait, you said you completed a mission. What mission?" Tatl pressed, her wings flicking with renewed energy. "You can't just leave it there, you've </span>
      <span class="c4">piqued</span>
      <span class="c0"> my interest!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"It was a long time ago… I don't really want to talk about it," I muttered, already regretting letting anything slip.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Oh come </span>
      <span class="c4">on</span>
      <span class="c0">! You said that before, but I told you a little about my past. Why don't you return the favor?" she begged, drifting close with an expectant tilt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ugh… fine. I guess that's fair." I sighed, rubbing the bridge of my nose. "Okay, here's the short version. A thief named Ganondorf stole a sacred relic that granted his wish to rule the world. He declared himself King of Evil, enslaved the races of Hyrule, and I was chosen to stop him. So I did—with help from... people I trusted."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"That's </span>
      <span class="c4">all</span>
      <span class="c7 c6">…? That's the best you can do? You can't just </span>
      <span class="c4">drop</span>
      <span class="c0"> something like that and not deliver. Gimme more!" she pushed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I groaned. "Alright. I cleansed evil from seven temples—each one crawling with monsters, traps, curses. Fought through endless hordes, rescued the sages who’d been imprisoned, sealed Ganondorf in a void of darkness... and then got shoved back in time to relive my childhood. Like it all never happened."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well... it’s better than nothing," Tatl said, though her voice had softened. "One day I’ll break through that guarded little hero heart, but for now I guess I’ll let you be mysterious."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yup. Legendary hero. Or... I was." My voice came out quieter than I meant. "Before I was sent back. I had night terrors for months after. Waking up thinking the world had ended. Zelda… she was there for me. Helped me adjust. Helped me... let go."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Who's Zelda? She sounds nice."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"She was the Princess of Hyrule. Now the Queen, probably." I tried to sound casual, but even her name stirred something old and aching in my chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Wow. I gotta say, I wouldn’t have guessed you were the ‘falling-for-royalty’ type," Tatl whistled. "All noble and tragic."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I never said I was in love," I snapped, a little too quickly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"It was totally in your voice when you said her name, you </span>
      <span class="c4">cannot</span>
      <span class="c0"> deny it," she teased. "And it sounds like she cared about you too. No wonder you're all moody and evasive—you feel guilty for leaving her behind."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No! That's not...it…" I sighed, Tatl was right. "Look...I just don't belong with a princess. I'm a battle-hardened warrior, and Hyrule is in a time of peace. I can't live like that, not after everything I'd been put through. How could Zelda possibly be happy with someone like me?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I dunno, love isn't my strong suit. But I doubt that Zelda cares. I think when all this is over, you should go back and tell her how you feel."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"I don't even know how to get back, let alone survive this place! Besides, </span>
      <span class="c4">look</span>
      <span class="c0"> at me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I gestured to my feminine form and kicked a rock in frustration. Pain rippled through my foot and I stumbled, hopping on one leg as I massaged my stubbed toe.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Owww! Arrgh! I'm done talking about this!" I screamed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My shrill voice echoed through the swamp, startling birds from the branches above in a flurry of wings. The sting faded, but the embarrassment lingered. Not from the pain—real as it was—but from the rawness of being seen while my emotions were falling apart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Alright, alright! </span>
      <span class="c4">Sheesh</span>
      <span class="c0">! Calm down before you summon that bloodcurdling monster again!" Tatl waved frantically, scanning the shadows. "I'm sorry... forget I mentioned anything."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I glared at the ground, blinking away the rain that had fallen into my eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Only... it wasn’t raining.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl hovered closer, her glow dimming into something gentler—but she didn’t speak. Not right away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Instead, she lingered beside me in silence. And for once, it wasn’t filled with quips or questions. Just quiet understanding. I could feel her watching me—not with pity, but with a dawning clarity. Like she was seeing past the mask for the first time, seeing the shape of someone scarred beneath all the silence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I didn’t want her to see it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I </span>
      <span class="c4">did</span>
      <span class="c0"> want her to see it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I looked down at my hands—smaller now, softer, uncertain—and sighed heavily.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Maybe," I muttered, eyes fixed on the shifting mist ahead. "Maybe I was in love. Maybe... it’s complicated."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The words felt too small for the weight they carried. Like naming a wound didn’t make it bleed any less.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Love didn’t stop her from turning back the clock. It didn’t hold back… fate. And it sure didn’t stop me from getting torn out of one life and thrown into another." I paused. "She…ugh…she did what she thought was right. Maybe she </span>
      <span class="c4">was</span>
      <span class="c0"> right. I just... I don’t know where I’m supposed to put any of it now."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl’s voice came at last, quiet and low. “Maybe… you don’t have to. Not yet. Maybe it’s okay if it doesn’t make sense for a while.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I glanced at her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She didn’t look away. “You’ve been carrying all that without a break, haven’t you? Always trying to be the hero, even when no one’s looking. Even when it’s tearing you apart.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I said nothing. I didn’t have to.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">“You know… um… you’re not alone now,” she said, more gently than I’d ever heard her. “You don’t have to carry it all by yourself. Not with me here.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Her glow warmed slightly, a soft pulse of light in the gray. Not bright, not bold—just enough to be felt, like a hand quietly reaching out in the dark.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">And I found myself—just for a moment—believing her. Wanting to believe her. That someone could stand beside me and </span>
      <span class="c4">see</span>
      <span class="c0"> the ruin without flinching.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Let's... just keep moving," I said, my voice rough with emotion. Not dismissive—just worn. Like the words were walking on blistered feet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">She didn’t argue. Just stayed close, her glow surreal against the fog. Her silence said more than comfort ever could. She was </span>
      <span class="c4">with</span>
      <span class="c0"> me. No expectations. No judgment. Just presence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And we kept walking, the mist curling around our legs like memories too stubborn to fade—but now, for the first time in a long time, not entirely alone in them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I chose to remain quiet until we reached the boathouse. Thankfully, Tatl followed my lead—but her words kept echoing through my mind like ripples over a wound that refused to close. She had seen more than I meant to show. And worse—she’d been right. But admitting that to her? To myself? That was still too much.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I knew how Zelda had looked at me. I knew what we shared, unspoken as it often was. But my happiness... that had been forfeit long ago. Offered up to the gods the moment I drew the Master Sword and stepped into the timestream. Zelda belonged to Hyrule, to peace, to golden rooms and measured words. She deserved the warmth of sunlit courtyards, the laughter of children, soft hands and safer futures. I was none of that. I was the shadow that lingered after the fire. A sword with no sheath. A name whispered in temples and forgotten at home.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I was built for battle and adventure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Despite the curses that clung to every branch, and the unease that coiled like fog at my ankles, part of me—some twisted part—almost </span>
      <span class="c4">enjoyed</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> the trek through the bog. There was a rawness here. A thrill beneath the dread. Like walking a knife’s edge with bare feet. The uncertainty hummed through my bones like the prelude to battle. It gave me </span>
      <span class="c4">purpose</span>
      <span class="c0">. Purpose I hadn’t felt since the last seal closed the Demon King in the abyss and silence fell over the kingdom.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Peace had starved me. Six years of it had eroded me in ways no war ever could. Without a threat, I was just... leftover. Rusting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">So I came here. To a place that still bled. Where monsters still hunted and evil still whispered in the dark. Here, I wasn’t obsolete. Here, I </span>
      <span class="c4">mattered</span>
      <span class="c0">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The trail ended at a long, weathered boardwalk. Planks groaned beneath my boots as I stepped onto it, damp with moss and slick with age. Mist curled like breath around my ankles, coiling up from the dark water below. The air smelled brackish—part algae, part rot, tinged faintly with woodsmoke and something faintly sickly sweet, like an old corpse.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The world fell quiet, as if holding its breath. Lanterns glowed faintly at the head of the pier, casting amber halos into the fog like tired eyes that refused to close. Further down the dock, nestled into the mist, stood an owl statue—weathered, half-covered in lichen, but unmistakable. Its eyes were shut, wings folded, like it was waiting for something.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Across the water, a two-story shack floated gently, tethered by thick ropes to half-submerged pylons. The building creaked softly with each ripple of the swamp, like it was murmuring in its sleep. Smoke curled from its chimney in a lazy spiral, tracing a slow path upward into the gray.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Alright, here we are. Are you OK, Link?" Tatl chimed, her voice careful—not too light, not too prying.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah, I'm fine… I just had to work through some things," I said, forcing a breath past the tightness in my chest. "I just want to say… that you were right. I'm not good at talking about this stuff. And I'm sorry. For being such an idiot."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl hovered a little closer, her glow warmer than the lanterns. "Hey... thanks for saying that. You’re not an idiot. Just... damaged goods like the rest of us."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I snorted softly. "Thanks.... I think."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You're welcome," she said, and for once, we both laughed. Just a little.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And for a heartbeat, the fog didn’t feel so heavy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The boardwalk swayed gently beneath our steps, the wood groaning with age and damp. Ripples fanned out through the stagnant water with each footfall, disturbing floating debris and clumps of green algae. Gnats and flies buzzed persistently around our heads, drawn to the sweat and lantern glow. I swatted at them half-heartedly, my mind still half-lost in memory. The smell of mildew, river mud, and faint smoke drifted in the air, thick as the mist.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We reached the weather-beaten door of the boathouse, its surface warped with years of exposure. I knocked with my knuckles—three sharp raps—and heard the shuffle of movement inside. A small peephole snapped open, and a gruff voice echoed from within.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Eh? What do ye want!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"We would like to rent a boat. Do you have any available?" Tatl answered politely.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"A boat? Nah, this is the photography club. The boat rental’s up the ladder to the left! But ahhh... the owner, Koume, hasn’t been by in a few days!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The man’s voice boomed with a thick, unplaceable accent, every syllable dragged out like rope soaked in molasses.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, okay then... do you know any other boat shops around here?" I asked, leaning closer to the opening. "We're kind of in a hurry."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Nope, 'fraid this is the only place 'round here with boats! Tell ye what though, you two look straight bushed! Why don’t ya both come inside for a nice cuppa 'n warm yer spirits. I’m sure ye can spare a tic after hoofin’ it over 'ere!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The heavy door creaked inward on rusted hinges, revealing a formidable man with a closely-shaved black beard and mirror-tinted glasses that flashed in the lantern light. A brown leather flight cap was pulled tight over his head, and his massive arm gestured us in with the ease of someone used to taking up space. His vest, worn and sun-faded, clung to a thick, hairy torso and a bulging gut, and beneath it, a pair of comically small white-and-red pinstriped trousers barely clung to his frame.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I cast Tatl a sideways glance and shrugged.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She gave a small nod, and we stepped into the warm, flickering light of the cabin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Awright, make yerselves at home. I got the tea goin' on the mantle," the mountainous man bellowed, his voice booming with that unmistakable swamptung lilt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The cabin chamber was cozy and worn-in, smelling faintly of cedar smoke and damp wool. Dim lanterns hung from exposed beams, casting soft golden pools of light over the mismatched furniture. The walls were cluttered with curling photographs—sepia-toned snapshots of travelers, misty lagoons, and half-submerged ruins. A few taxidermied fish, preserved mid-thrash, hung above a display of homemade bows and rusted tools.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A large couch sagged against the far wall, draped in an old knitted throw. Several leafy potted plants clustered beside a squat little table, their fronds reaching like curious hands toward the heat of the fire. The man waved us toward it, and we obliged, sinking into the creaking cushions.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He thumped over to the fireplace, where a small kettle hissed quietly over glowing coals. He stirred them with a blackened iron poker, sending a puff of embers into the air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"So, what brings you two birds to this armpit of Termina? We don't get too many fair folk such as yerselves down 'ere," he asked with a broad grin, revealing a missing tooth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Before we could answer, the man clapped a massive hand over his face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"</span>
      <span class="c4">Strewth!</span>
      <span class="c0"> How could I be so crass to not make proper acquaintances! I'm called Frank, if it so pleases ye both." He executed a flourishing bow with surprising grace for someone of his size. "How might I call you?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well, my name is Link… and this is Tatl."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well, 'tis a pleasure to meet ya!" Frank said, ambling behind a cluttered counter at the other end of the room. He rummaged briefly through a drawer full of mismatched mugs. "So, a boat… are ye here to see th' sights? I'm a tour guide of sorts, and I know me way 'round the swamp like the back o' me clamp!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ummm, kind of, I think?" I replied, still working to decipher his colorful dialect. "We're hunting the monster that's causing havoc here."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Frank paused, mug halfway to the counter. His jovial expression stiffened. Slowly, he leaned forward, elbows bracing against the bar’s edge.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The smile never quite left his face—but it no longer reached his eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Blimey! Yer serious!" The man scratched his exposed, hairy chest with thick fingers. "You best stay away from that beast, sheila! Matter o’ fact, ye best flee this bloody swamp altogether!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"It's Link," I said sharply, straightening. "And we can't leave. I can handle myself, and we were sent to deal with the monster." Tatl hovered beside me, nodding in solidarity.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I apologize for me swamptung... 'Sheila' is just a word we use down 'ere for spunky young lasses such as yerself," he said with a sheepish grin. "But I’m bloody serious—ye gotta get out while ya still can. Odalwa ain’t an ordinary monster."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Odalwa?" Tatl echoed, brow furrowing. "That thing has a </span>
      <span class="c4">name</span>
      <span class="c0">?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeh. Used to be just a ghost story we told the wee ones to keep 'em from wanderin'. ‘Bog in to yer rat stew, Bill and Sally, or Ol’ Odalwa’ll tear yer tongue out!’ That sort o’ thing. But they ain’t just tales no more. Somethin’ woke it up. It’s real now, and it's been snatchin' folk."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"So… what you're saying is a storybook monster came to life. And now it's hunting people," I said, flatly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Right-o! And from what I seen and heard, it favors little sheilas like </span>
      <span class="c4">you.</span>
      <span class="c0"> So I’m beggin’ ya—get outta dodge before it’s too late."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I rose from the couch, jaw tight. "No. Look, if you can’t or won’t help us, we’re going either way."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Frank raised his hands defensively. "Wait jist a tic, mate! Hear me out, yeh? If yer gonna be trouncin’ about the swamp, you’ll need a boat, at the very least. That fancy bow o’ yours won’t do much against Odalwa, if you’re serious about huntin’ it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Then what do you suggest?" I muttered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Koume’s sister, Kotake, runs a magic shop east of here. Strange old bird, but wise as the tide. She might know where Koume’s gotten off to. And chances are, she’s got some thingummy or charm that might help ye survive out there."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He scratched behind his ear, his tone softening. "I'd be heaps grateful if ya found Koume. Business has been dryer than a dead Deku without my boat captain."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I exchanged a glance with Tatl, who nodded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Sounds like we’d be killing two birds with one stone. Where’s the shop, exactly?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Coupla clicks east. Stick to the shoreline and you’ll see the path clear as day. Big crooked trees and some glowy fungus’ll light yer way."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Right. Thank you for your... kind... hospitality, Frank," I said, heading toward the exit. "But I think we’ll have to take a rain check on that tea."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Frank gave a knowing chuckle and tipped an imaginary hat. "Fair winds, then. And may yer feet stay dry and yer bow stay true."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I waved once, and stepped back into the fog with Tatl at my side, the door creaking shut behind us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Swamp dwellers… so weird." Tatl shook her head, her tiny voice tinged with amusement and mild exasperation. "I can barely ever understand them—and they're all pretty crazy. But... I guess you'd have to be, living in a place like this."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I laughed softly, the sound a little hoarse in the heavy air, and started down the boardwalk toward solid ground.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Alright. We should hurry. I can't imagine we have much time left before the moon falls."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl floated upward, scanning the thick clouds overhead for a glimpse of the doomed sky.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I can't tell either, but you're probably right. He said the shop was east of here, shouldn’t be too far a walk. I’m more worried about what he said about Odalwa…" She glanced around, her glow dimming slightly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"If we see any fog drifting our way, we’ll hide—same as before. Don’t worry. We’ve made it this far." I tried to sound calm, steady. My boots squished into the mossy earth, the wet ground sucking at each step.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Okay, you’re the hero," Tatl said, not quite reassured, but choosing to trust me anyway.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She drifted in closer, her light brushing against my shoulder—not a nudge, not an accident. A quiet signal. A promise.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Whatever came next, we’d face it together.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I smiled faintly and gave her a thumbs-up, the gesture small but sincere. She chuckled, a fragile sound that stirred the air around us like wind through reeds.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The shallow mud squelched beneath our feet as we moved eastward into the pale haze of the swamp. Ferns and vine-choked trunks loomed in the fog like the silhouettes of forgotten sentinels. Crickets whispered. Distant birds shrieked once and fell silent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">With each step, the quiet thickened. The squelch of my boots faded beneath the hush, swallowed by the stillness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And I couldn’t shake the feeling—that every step forward was drawing us nearer to something nameless. Not just a beast or a shadow or a trap, but something older. Something watching.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The mist curled at our heels like ghosts, and even with Tatl’s gentle glow beside me, the weight of the sky pressed down harder with each breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Whatever lay ahead—monster, memory, or madness—it wasn’t just a threat to overcome.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">It was a reckoning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And I had to face it—not just for Termina, but for every fractured piece of myself scattered through this dying world. My name, my purpose, my fate… they all waited in that dark. So I stepped forward—into the dread, into the waiting dark—toward the reckoning that bore my name.</span>

    </h1>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The swamplands grew darker and more oppressive as the day died slowly, suffocated beneath a sky of muddy orange and bruised violet clouds. The sunset was smothered completely, hidden by thick stormbanks that loomed in the distance. The deluge promised that morning had never come, but its absence felt like a curse rather than a mercy. Distant thunder rumbled low across the horizon, a constant growl that never ceased, as if some vast beast circled just beyond the horizon, patiently stalking us, waiting for nightfall. Still, the air hung heavy and soured—dense with the stench of algae, molded rot, and something deeper that filled my lungs with dread. Breathing it in made my throat itch. It felt like the swamp was trying to get inside me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl and I picked our way along the marshy shoreline, boots sucking into damp earth that squelched and gurgled with every step. The buzzing of insects that had plagued us earlier began to fade, replaced by a sinister hush. Birds, too, had gone silent. It wasn’t peaceful. It was the kind of silence that animals used to warn each other that a predator was near. I tried not to dwell on it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Frank, the strange but hospitable tour guide of the boathouse, had told us of a Magic Shop somewhere further down the bank. According to him, the shop owner’s sister was likely still there and might have the key to the locked boat. We followed that hope. Tatl drifted close to my shoulder, veering away from the more toxic patches of marsh, her gaze darting restlessly into the mist-choked trees as if expecting them to move.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What if we run into Odalwa on the way to the magic shop? It was bad enough to look at in broad daylight, and I certainly don't want to be grabbed by the monster!" Tatl flitted about nervously, startling at every movement within the mists.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Don't worry about it, we'll just hide like last time. If it can't see us, then we'll be just fine." I offered a weak grin. "Worst case, I throw you at it and run."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Excuse me?! I am not bait! I am a dazzling orb of wisdom and guidance! You throw me at a monster and I will personally haunt you in every temple from here to Termina Field."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"See? You’d make a great distraction. Loud </span>
      <span class="c4">and</span>
      <span class="c0"> glowy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I joked lightly, but a brief pang of guilt twisted in my chest at her glare. Truthfully, I’d sooner fling myself into danger than risk her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl huffed and glared, but the glow around her pulsed a little warmer, less frantic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Frank said the shop isn’t far," I added more gently. "We’ll be there soon."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"He also said people like you were Odalwa's favorite victims. You know—small, brave, tragically stab-happy types. And it’s getting dark… what if it sneaks up on us and kidnaps you like the others?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I highly doubt that a big monster could sneak around so easily. Plus, I’ve noticed my hearing’s a lot better since... well, you know." I tapped my temple. "New ears and all..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Oh perfect. So we’ll </span>
      <span class="c4">hear</span>
      <span class="c0"> it coming before it eats you. Great comfort."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I tried to keep my tone light for her sake, but truthfully, her fear was starting to creep into my own bones. The longer we walked, the more the shadows seemed to shift and breathe around us. My gut was twisting with unease, a wordless signal screaming from the same primal place that made the animals flee before a storm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hrrmm ok...if you say so. You're the warrior here, not me. I suppose you'd know the situation best." Tatl took a deep breath and blew it out slowly, as if trying to physically push her nerves down. "So... I wonder what happened to the boat lady. Do you think she got taken, like the others?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"I hope not," I muttered. "We don't even know where they're being kept. Plus we really need a boat here. I wouldn't </span>
      <span class="c4">dare</span>
      <span class="c0"> swim in that stuff!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Even thinking about it made my skin crawl—murky water thick with algae, debris, and who-knew-what corpses bloating under the surface.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"If she was kidnapped, then there's apparently no way we can get a boat, and we'd be stuck. So please, don't jinx it for us."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'm just saying... we should have a backup plan or something…" Tatl grumbled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ugh... fine. I guess you're right." I sighed. "Keep an eye out for anything we can possibly use as a raft. There's gotta be driftwood along the banks we can lash together. But stay away from the treeline—if I were a monster, that's where I'd be lurking."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We scanned the banks as we walked, our eyes flicking between patches of reeds and half-sunken logs, the last slivers of daylight fading fast. The air was still thick and warm, reeking of mold and death. When we rounded a bend in the lagoon, a sickly-sweet stench slammed into me like a blunt weapon. I gagged and glanced around frantically, something was wrong here.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The water ahead had turned a curdled shade of purplish-brown, its oily surface slicked with bloated fish and bits of unidentifiable gore. The banks were mottled with black silt and flies, buzzing in lazy, grotesque swirls.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Uh, Link? I have a bad feeling about this area," Tatl whispered, barely audible against the dense silence. "Look at the water. Do you think... that thing could be nearby?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"It's a good chance," I said, scanning the treeline. My eyes caught a fallen log near the shore. "Quick, let’s take cover over there."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We moved fast but low, instinctively hunched, every squelch of our boots in the muck sounding like a gunshot in the hush. I ducked behind the log while Tatl slipped inside my cloak like a trembling ember.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">For long moments we held our breath. Nothing moved.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I slowly lifted my head to peek. The lagoon had gone still, deathly still, as if even the wind had stopped breathing. Purple-grey clouds loomed overhead, reflected in the mirrored slime of the water. Algae clumped like floating bruises on the surface. Across the way, a thick copse of moss-draped trees hung in silence, their vines swaying just barely—as if something had brushed past them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c20">
      <span class="c0"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I peered into the trees across the stagnant water, straining my eyes for movement among the gnarled trunks and weeping vines. The air was still, sticky, and so thick it felt like it could be sliced. A sudden explosion of motion snapped my gaze upward—birds erupted from the canopy in a flurry of panicked wings, screeching as they fled from something unseen. The sound faded quickly, swallowed by the thick fog.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The swamp held its breath. Everything stilled to unnatural silence. Then came the footfalls—heavy, distant, rhythmic… Each one sent subtle tremors through the earth, vibrating up through my boots and into my bones. The lagoon's mirrored surface rippled with each impact, breaking apart reflections like shattered glass. My stomach knotted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I didn’t breathe. Didn’t blink. Just waited.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">With a splintering crash, Odalwa burst through the trees—its enormous form exploding into view like a nightmare made real. Its sword, jagged and grotesque, cleaved through low-hanging branches as if they were paper. Its body was painted in crude war markings, masked by a twisted wooden faceplate riddled with nails and carvings. It stomped to the water’s edge, its movements oddly stiff, like a puppet being jerked forward by invisible strings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Then it sniffed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Sharp, wet gasps sucked in through the slits of the mask, each one sounding like the gurgle of drowning lungs. It tilted its head left, then right, twitching with each breath. My blood turned to ice as its hollow eye-holes swiveled in our direction.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I ducked behind the log, heart pounding in my ears like a war drum. The wood was trembling against my spine with each of the thing’s steps. Tatl let out a tiny whimper inside the cloak, her glow dimming almost to nothing. I slipped a hand back to my belt, fingers closing around the mask. If it came closer—</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A shriek split the stillness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">From across the lagoon, dozens of furious howls echoed, followed by a clatter of thrown stones. The monkeys. A chaotic barrage of screeching erupted from the canopy as rocks pelted the monster’s face and shoulders. I could hear them thunking against its wooden mask—sharp cracks and splinters flying.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Odalwa let out a guttural roar and spun on its heel, the sheer vibration of its voice rippling the water. It charged across the swamp in a furious, thudding sprint, crashing after the monkeys as they scattered into the trees like startled leaves.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I dared to raise my head. The log creaked as I shifted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Dozens of monkeys—mud-caked, shaggy, and wildly different in shape and size—were perched in the treetops, flinging anything they could get their hands on: rocks, fruit, even bones. The scene was primal and chaotic, but to my amazement, they were holding their ground. The liquid rot from its body spewed into the waters as the monster moved, and the monkeys retreated back into the safety of the woods.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My hand trembled around the mask. That had been too close. One more second... one single misplaced breath...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Tatl stirred faintly in my cloak. "That was </span>
      <span class="c4">way</span>
      <span class="c0"> too close."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah," I whispered. "I noticed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">When everything was quiet and calm once more, we both breathed a huge sigh of relief.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"See? </span>
      <span class="c4">Whew</span>
      <span class="c0"> Not a problem," I said with a shaky laugh. "We could see it from a mile away! Totally under control."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl zipped out from under my cloak with a scowl. "You were about ten seconds from getting pancaked! If it hadn’t been for those monkeys, we’d be monster chow."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well… maybe," I admitted, rubbing the back of my neck. "I could’ve transformed and taken a swing at it. Might be smart to put the mask on ahead of time next time."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, perfect. Loud thumping and dramatic transformation sparkles in the middle of a stealth mission—great plan." Tatl zipped between me and the mask, glowing brighter in frustration. "Seriously, you’re not exactly Mister Subtle with that thing on."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Okay, okay! Point taken. But if we bump into Odalwa again, don’t expect a well-timed costume change."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">She sighed, drifting back beside me. "Let’s just </span>
      <span class="c4">not</span>
      <span class="c0"> bump into him again. Deal?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Deal."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We trudged back toward the shore, following the murky lagoon, the last echoes of monkey screeches fading behind us like distant war cries. Whether they meant to save us or not, I owed them a debt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Twilight settled over the swamp like a burial shroud. The light drained from the sky, replaced by a hazy gray-blue gloom that seeped into everything—water, bark, skin. The whole world felt damp and grave-cold. Trickling streams bled into the main body of water—sickly green and black, oozing like veins across the mire, carrying with them strange slicks of iridescent oil that shimmered with unnatural colors.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We passed bloated animal corpses half-submerged in the muck, their skin blistered and peeling, limbs stiff in death. Some had sunken eyes filled with maggots, others had mouths frozen open in silent screams. Flies buzzed in maddened spirals, thick enough to form clouds that dispersed only when we neared. Gnats bit at my face and neck, leaving itchy welts that throbbed with each heartbeat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Bones, long picked clean, jutted from the silt like broken fingers reaching for mercy—or perhaps warning us back. A stench of rot and chemical decay clung to the air, thicker than fog, crawling into my nose and mouth until I nearly gagged. Each breath felt like inhaling poison.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The ground squelched beneath our feet, soft and treacherous. My boot slipped once on a patch of black slime and I caught myself on a twisted root that oozed decayed matter the color of dried blood.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I pulled my cloak tighter, but it didn’t help. Nothing could. The swamp was death—slow, sticky, and inescapable. And it was watching us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c20">
      <span class="c0"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c20">
      <span class="c0"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Ughh.. I'm thinking we should just walk through the trees and forget following the shore! These flies are driving me </span>
      <span class="c4">nuts</span>
      <span class="c6 c7">!" I hissed to Tatl, flailing at the relentless swarm buzzing around my face. They were in my ears, up my nose—one even tried to crawl </span>
      <span class="c4">into</span>
      <span class="c0"> my mouth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"What about the shop? Frank said to follow the shore—" Tatl ducked as I swatted at a particularly aggressive gnat. "Hey! Watch it! I do </span>
      <span class="c4">not</span>
      <span class="c0"> want to get knocked out by your flailing."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I turned to apologize—and nearly stepped on a decomposing goose. The burst of stench that hit me was immediate and vile.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Urghh—gross!" I gagged, leaping awkwardly over it. My foot landed ankle-deep in a patch of squelching, sour mud. "Oh COME on!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Tatl winced as I yanked my boot free with a wet slurp. "That poor bird. How did it even </span>
      <span class="c4">get</span>
      <span class="c0"> here?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No idea," I muttered. "But I'm done with this. Let's move over there—before I end up face-first in a pile of swamp meat."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stomped toward the tangled treeline, boots squishing, cloak dragging muck. Tatl zipped after me, trying to escape the thickest cloud of biting insects.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"And what if we run into monsters back there?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Honestly? I’d rather deal with a monster than trip over one more dead goose."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That’s a bold strategy. 'Death by bog beast' versus 'death by bird blunder.' Truly heroic."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"We’re probably near the shop by now anyway. Monsters don’t usually hang around where there’s signs of people... right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl glanced around the gloom. "This place hasn’t looked 'people-friendly' in a decade. But hey, if you say so, Hero."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Relax. We’ve got this. Just stay close."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Pfft...sometimes I wish I had your confidence," she muttered, landing delicately on my shoulder. Her wings drooped just a little. "But I guess after all the crap you’ve faced, a little murder-mud and monster-stench is nothing."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Well, once you've been sucked inside a giant whale, travelled through time, defeated the </span>
      <span class="c4">literal </span>
      <span class="c0">King of Evil, or changed into the opposite gender, I think you'd be surprised at what you can accomplish. At that point there's really nothing that can surprise you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl let out a genuine laugh. "Okay, fair. You’ve earned your swamp swagger. Maybe I’ll borrow some."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Just don’t borrow my boots. They’ve officially died."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Duly noted. I'm glad I can fly."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She flexed with a tiny hum, mimicking a bodybuilder pose. I snorted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Alright, tough girl. Let’s tone it down—I think I see something up ahead. Building-shaped. Maybe we’re finally close."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I ran to the carved wooden structure ahead, heart pounding with each step, trying to stay silent as the trees loomed like sentinels around me. The encroaching darkness made everything seem warped and surreal. The gateway before me was a strange burst of color in the gloom—etched with painted owls, foxes, and glowing symbols in vibrant reds and blues. Beneath it, a worn sign read: "This way to Kotake's Magic Shop, for all your mystical needs!" The arrow beneath the cheerful script felt almost mocking.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well, I'm glad we're almost there. It's getting really hard to see out here, plus these flies are getting on my last nerves!" I slapped at my arm again, feeling the wet crunch of a crushed bug against my skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I couldn't agree more, I was about to say that myself… I'm being attacked from all sides!" Tatl flailed her tiny arms like she was drowning in a storm of gnats.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We passed through the archway, and the air instantly grew heavier, wetter. The dirt path narrowed and twisted through choking underbrush, while moss hung like streamers from crooked limbs above. Somewhere to our right, an animal let out a guttural cry—abrupt, short, then silence. I paused. Tatl hovered close, glancing around with wide eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Probably just a wolfos," I whispered. "They hunt at dusk."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The light dropped sharply. What little sun remained was swallowed by the canopy above, casting long shadows that shifted as though breathing. Tatl nudged my arm, pointing at something ahead—a flickering orange glow weaving through the dark trees.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey, what's that? You think it could be someone who needs help?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Umm, maybe... but we need to get to that shop."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah but... what if they're in trouble?" She fluttered anxiously toward the treeline. "C'mon, let’s go see!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A flash of silver blurred past us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">With a deafening crack, a tree exploded in front of Tatl, showering her in bark and splinters. She screamed. My instincts kicked in—just as a massive, gnarled hand lunged from the shadows toward me. The skin was stretched taut over blackened bone, riddled with fungus and oozing pustules. I barely twisted away in time, rolling into the wet leaves and dirt, heart stuttering.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Odalwa. Again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I bolted behind a tree as the ground shook beneath the thing’s steps. Tatl zipped upward, her glow panicked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Link! Watch out!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The monster’s massive blade carved through the air, slashing through vines and trees as if they were tissue. It moved with terrifying purpose—this wasn’t a wild swing. It was hunting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I dove behind a bush as the sword cleaved my previous hiding place clean in two. Wood detonated in splinters. Leaves shot upward in a burst of green and brown. The very air seemed to recoil, buzzing with static and the scent of burning rot. A guttural wail—inhuman and primal—rattled my bones, deep and resonant, like the cry of something ancient and wrong.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Then I saw its face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The mask’s eyes turned toward me—twin voids of pitch black, bottomless and lightless, pulling in every flicker of the world around them. They weren’t just empty—they were devouring. Shadows bent toward them. My heart seized.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Black ichor oozed from the corners of the mask like tar-slick tears, dripping steadily onto the moss and hissing where it landed. Thin veins of fungus pulsed along its surface, glowing faintly like embers under skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">It didn’t see me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">It </span>
      <span class="c4">sensed</span>
      <span class="c0"> me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">No time to transform.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I wrapped trembling fingers around my bow, notched a magic arrow, and aimed through the foliage. The faint glow lit up the brush—too late.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The creature's head snapped in my direction. It roared, louder than thunder. A wall of sound and fury.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And it charged.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I tried diving away back into cover as Odalwa charged toward me, flinging broken trees every which way like a tantrum of nature itself. One of the soaring trunks clipped me in the left shoulder, and the impact exploded in white-hot agony. I screamed, a raw and guttural sound, as my body twisted midair and slammed into the ground. I hit hard, my lungs seizing up, my vision clouding. Pain exploded through my shoulder in searing white-hot waves, each breath agony. My vision blurred with tears, limbs unresponsive, useless. Terror surged, bitter and choking. I had never felt this vulnerable—this powerless.. Every heartbeat sent another lance of torment down my side.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The ground shook as Odalwa’s massive footfalls closed the distance. My heart thundered. I blinked away tears, mud clinging to my face. And then—</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">It loomed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The mask hovered inches from my face, steaming breath washing over me like a swamp fog from a rotting beast. The stench made me gag—sour, fungal, and metallic. Black ichor dribbled from its jaw, sizzling where it hit the earth. The hollow eye sockets stared into me—those unnatural voids that swallowed all light, all hope.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">My limbs refused to move. My shattered shoulder sent waves of paralysis through me. My good hand scrabbled weakly at the dirt, reaching for a branch, a weapon, </span>
      <span class="c4">anything</span>
      <span class="c0">. But I couldn’t escape.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Get away from me!" I shrieked, voice breaking with terror. I tried to slide back, but my body wouldn’t obey. My arm collapsed beneath me and I fell sideways into the muck.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The mask tilted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The monster reached for me—its twisted hands gnarled like dead wood, dripping with ooze, its fingers twitching like it could already feel my throat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And then—</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She hurled herself in front of the mask, clutching a jagged splinter of wood. With a sharp cry, she drove it straight into the thing’s eye.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 936.00px;">

      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The sound was unbearable. A screech tore through the swamp like a siren, rattling the trees and my skull alike. Purple liquid jetted from the mask’s eye socket, spraying in thick arcs that hissed when it hit the dirt and plants. Odalwa stumbled back, claws clutching at the embedded shard, convulsing in rage.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl dropped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She fell limp, tumbling end over end until her tiny body hit the ground like a fallen ember. Her glow flickered erratically, fading.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Tatl! Tatl, are you—</span>
      <span class="c4">gasp</span>
      <span class="c0">—okay!?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I dragged myself toward her with my good arm, each movement a scream inside my nerves. Twigs tore my skin. Vines tangled my legs. But I didn’t care.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She was lying in a nest of debris, her little limbs trembling, her face smeared with that same grotesque purple ooze. Her breaths came in short, shallow bursts—barely there.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Tatl! No, no no no—stay with me! Come on! Please!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I reached out and cradled her tiny body in my palm, feeling her weak pulse through my dirty fingers. She didn’t respond.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I sobbed, helpless. The swamp pressed in from all sides.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">“Tatl! Tatl, please—”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My voice broke, raw with panic and grief. I cradled her tiny, trembling form gently, fear squeezing my heart like a vise. I could lose anyone, anything—but not her. Never her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Then—</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The ground thundered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Odalwa had recovered. It stood tall and furious, blade raised in a high arc. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t run. I had nothing left.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">It let out a roar—a bellow of hate and hunger—and charged.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I closed my eyes, clutching Tatl to my chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And waited for the end.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">An icy blast of freezing air suddenly whizzed past my face, so sharp and dry it sliced the breath from my lungs. A thunderous </span>
      <span class="c4">thwomp</span>
      <span class="c0"> followed, shaking the ground like a boulder had fallen from the sky. I dared to crack one eye open.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Odalwa’s massive, decaying form lay toppled, now encased in a thick, crystalline coffin of ice. Frozen mid-lunge, its blade still half-raised, the monster let out muted, muffled groans from behind the frost, its limbs twitching just slightly beneath the surface. Steam hissed from the seams of the block as the swamp’s heat began to eat away at the edges, but for the moment—blessedly—it was trapped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Then she appeared.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The hag swooped in from the trees like a phantom wind, hunched low upon a crooked broomstick that left a curling trail of shimmering frost in the air behind her. Her robes were tattered and layered, adorned with glowing runes and stitched charms that jingled faintly as she moved. Frost clung to the hems of her sleeves. Her skin was pale green and wrinkled like dry leather, and a massive sapphire glittered from the center of her towering violet turban.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I blinked, dazed, something was familiar about her. Her presence buzzed through me like static, familiar yet distant—like a name on the tip of my tongue. Where had I seen her before?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">With a guttural rasp, she raised her gnarled hands—decked in silver rings and bright lacquered nails—and chanted something low and ancient. The ground beneath the frozen monster rippled with crimson light, then split apart like paper. A swirling vortex of red magic yawned open, its edges crackling with raw power.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Odalwa groaned again, its massive body trembling within the melting ice. With a sharp gesture and a hissed word, the hag completed her spell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The frozen brute sank into the portal without a sound. One moment it was there—the next, it was swallowed by the red void. The portal snapped shut with a hiss, leaving behind only curling steam and scorched moss. A surge of relief and awe washed over me as Odalwa vanished into the swirling portal, replaced by stunned silence. We had escaped death—barely, impossibly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">The witch exhaled through her nose, satisfied, and gave a brisk nod. The sapphire on her turban flashed. She turned toward us, muttering something unintelligible—something about </span>
      <span class="c4">reckless girls and unfinished errands</span>
      <span class="c0">—as she glided closer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My body went limp.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">With the danger gone, all the adrenaline drained from me at once. The world swam before my eyes. The pain in my shoulder roared louder than ever. I tried to hold onto consciousness, but it slipped through my fingers like mist.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The last thing I saw was her boots touching the ground beside me, and a gloved hand reaching down, glowing softly with pale blue light. As darkness claimed me, I clung to a fragile hope that this witch—this savior—had arrived in time. Tatl’s small body still nestled in my palm was the last thing I felt as everything slipped away.</span>

    <h1 class="c13" id="h.hilwg54efcqi">
      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">Toil and Trouble</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c24">
      <span class="c0">A dull ache radiated from my shoulder as I slowly regained consciousness, the throb of pain pulsing in time with my heartbeat. My body felt heavy, wrapped in fatigue, and the air around me was thick with a strange and spicy smell that clung to the warmth like smoke in an enclosed room. My limbs felt like they were submerged in warm honey, sluggish and uncooperative. I was lying on a soft mat, and heard the faint sound of bubbling liquid nearby—a rhythmic, soothing noise like a distant cauldron simmering with secrets.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Footsteps approached—soft, deliberate. Something warm and wet gently plopped onto my shoulder, followed by a tug as it was wrapped and secured. A spike of pain lanced through me, sharp and sudden, and I sucked in a gasp through clenched teeth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My eyes flew open at the sting. The moss poultice pressed against my skin was warm and damp, its earthy, astringent scent blooming in the air like crushed herbs beneath a midsummer sun. I turned my head and tried to sit up, but a wrinkly, olive-toned hand pressed firmly against my chest, holding me down with surprising strength.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Stay there, you foolish child!" a voice croaked. "Your body’s still healing. No need to go flopping about like a fish out of water."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stared up at her—the same ancient hag who had frozen Odalwa in a block of ice. Her skin was cracked and weathered like bark, eyes bugged and sharp as beetles. She leaned over me, peering at my shoulder like it was a misbehaving experiment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"My potions work fast, yes, but not </span>
      <span class="c4">that</span>
      <span class="c0"> fast. Hmph! You’ll be up and charging into danger again soon enough. You’re lucky I found you when I did, you know. Not every day I scoop a screaming girl and her twitching glowbug off my front lawn."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I opened my mouth to speak, but my throat was scorched and dry, like I’d been chewing Gerudo desert sand for hours.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"T-Tatl..." I rasped, barely a whisper.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">The witch blinked. "Tattle? Tattle on </span>
      <span class="c4">who</span>
      <span class="c0">?" she asked, squinting in suspicion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I shook my head weakly. "My... my friend. Is she—cough, cough—is she okay?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Understanding dawned in her expression. She gave a grunt and waddled over to a cluttered table, rummaging among jars and flasks. "Ah, the fairy. Tough little puff of light, that one. Took a direct hit of Odalwa’s blood. Nasty, toxic stuff, that. But you’re lucky, you see—</span>
      <span class="c4">I’m</span>
      <span class="c0"> the greatest alchemist in all Termina! If anyone could save her, it’s me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A knot of fear in my chest loosened just slightly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"She’s not out of the woods yet," the witch added, grabbing a clear flask filled with milky white liquid. "But she’s stable. Breathing. Needs lots of rest. So do you, by the looks of it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I watched her closely as she turned, the light catching on the rings decorating her gnarled fingers. My gut twisted with doubt. After everything, could I trust her? Was this kindness... real? Or something worse hidden behind her craggy smile?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And yet, there was no real malice to her movements. Only practiced care. Purpose.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She returned to my side, holding the flask like a chalice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Here, drink this. It'll help to </span>
      <span class="c4">free</span>
      <span class="c0"> your parched tongue." The witch clucked softly, her tone lilting—but her grip on the flask was firm, insistent. She tilted the pungent substance to my lips without waiting for agreement.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The liquid was oddly sweet, thick with a flowery, perfumed essence that clung to my tongue. It tasted like violets crushed with honey and something faintly coppery beneath, like blood hidden beneath blossoms. As it slid down my throat, I felt the fire in my throat dim, the cracked dryness replaced with a soothing coolness. It relaxed me almost instantly. Too instantly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I closed my lips around the edge and pulled more of the tonic into my mouth—until she jerked the flask away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Alright, alright, that's enough. I don't need you drinking too much and becoming all giddy on me." She set the flask back onto the nearby table, with a more stern gleam in her eye. "Now then, would you tell me what you're doing with that enchanted bow?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">There was a weight behind the question. Not anger. Not threat. But something colder—expectation. Like a teacher who already knew the answer, and was just waiting to see how honest I’d be.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The ancient woman gestured to a shadowed corner, and my eyes followed her crooked finger. The dim flicker of a candle revealed my clothing and blue bow, neatly draped over a wall-mounted hook like museum artifacts. Dust motes drifted lazily through the beam of light, catching on the fine hairs of hanging herbs and glittering jars that lined the stone walls. The room was steeped in an overwhelming earthy scent—moss, dried roots, sharp tangs of preserved bark and bitter oil. It felt old, dense with secrets.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Seeing my belongings—laid out, handled, distant—sent a shiver through me. I felt exposed, small. Like something picked clean and set aside for study. My eyes dropped reflexively to myself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Bandages were tightly wrapped across the curves of my breasts, and a scratchy brown blanket clung to my hips and thighs. That was it. My legs, bare and cold beneath the thin wool, curled in instinctively. My cheeks flushed with heat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The old crone caught my mortified glance and cackled like wind through brittle branches.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh come now, hehehe, don't look so embarrassed. There isn't anything there I haven't seen before—not that you’ve got much to show, runt. Hardly any muscle at all. Now. About that bow."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Her sudden shift in tone—low and expectant—hit me like a jolt. I swallowed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"It was given to me by the Great Fairy," I said quickly, the words slipping out faster than I meant. I couldn’t stop myself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Is that so... huh." Her eyes narrowed like a snake in tall grass. "I would've hoped that such a wise fairy queen had better judgment. Why would she give a stupid young girl like </span>
      <span class="c4">you</span>
      <span class="c0"> something so powerful?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My stomach clenched. "Hey! I may have gotten ambushed by that creature out there, but I'm not stupid! The Great Fairy gave me that bow because she said I was the only hope for this world!" I pushed myself upright with trembling effort, only for her hand to slam me back into the bedding again. She was smiling. But there was nothing soft behind it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"The only hope? Ha! If I hadn't been picking mushrooms out there you'd be lizalfos stew meat by now—or strung up with the others, wherever that beast takes them!" she barked, her grin sharp and wolfish. "So you better tell Ol' Kotake the </span>
      <span class="c4">real</span>
      <span class="c0"> story... before I turn you into a Deku toad."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My breath caught.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Upon hearing her say that name, a jolt of recognition stabbed through me—cold and immediate. The dark-skinned hag’s face blurred with a memory from deep within the Spirit Temple: fire, mirrors, laughter like shattered glass. Kotake and Koume—Ganondorf’s surrogate mothers. My breath caught as I recalled the way their magic had twisted minds, corrupted the Gerudo, and nearly destroyed me. No wonder her voice unsettled me the moment I heard it. She was one of Ganondorf's surrogate mothers! Kotake and Koume! Years ago, I had to fight the powerful witches in the Spirit Temple, back in Hyrule! Their magic had twisted the minds of the Gerudo, built the backbone of Ganondorf’s army, and nearly destroyed me</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Wait! You're one of Ganondorf's minions!" I shouted, recoiling with raw panic. I tried to scoot back toward the wall—toward my bow—but the blanket tangled around my legs and I slipped in the rush. My heart hammered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Kotake’s eyes narrowed as she caught my ankle in her grip, surprisingly firm for someone so ancient. "What? How could you possibly…!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She froze, inspecting me more closely now—my ears, my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Are you from Hyrule? Tch, I should’ve guessed... But no. I'm not one of his sycophants, girl. Koume and I may have been of Ganondorf's tribe, but we fled before his evil spread thanks to a prophetic vision we saw of the Hero of Time bringing about our destruction.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">She stepped closer. "But how do </span>
      <span class="c4">you</span>
      <span class="c0"> even know about us? Our names were erased. Hidden by the Gerudo. You should not know. So—speak. SPIT IT OUT!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I glared up at her, defiant even as pain sang in my bones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Because </span>
      <span class="c4">I</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> was the one who defeated you. Both of you. And </span>
      <span class="c4">him</span>
      <span class="c0">. I’m the Hero of Time."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I slapped her bony hand away from my ankle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Her jaw dropped, then snapped shut like a steel trap. She barked a laugh—wild, shrill, and humorless.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Scat and swamp fumes! You're a petulant little girl with a head full of stories. Or maybe that potion knocked what few wits you had loose."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"I’m not a girl, you decrepit vine-witch! I was </span>
      <span class="c4">cursed</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> into this body by the Skull Kid! I </span>
      <span class="c4">infiltrated</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> your Spirit Temple, freed Nabooru, and killed you both using your own magic! I watched you </span>
      <span class="c4">fuse</span>
      <span class="c7 c6">, and I </span>
      <span class="c4">burned</span>
      <span class="c0"> you down with the mirror shield!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The laughter died. Kotake’s face went still.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And then, slow as shadow, she drew a small, silvered dagger from beneath her robes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The blade glinted—thin, curved, and wickedly sharp. She moved so close I could smell the acrid tingle of her alchemical robes, feel the stale heat of her breath on my cheek.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She placed the tip to my throat. The edge kissed skin. Then pressed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Who... are... you?" she hissed. Each word etched deeper. "You know </span>
      <span class="c4">far</span>
      <span class="c0"> too much. You're no lost little damsel."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Her eyes burned—not with anger, but with calculation. Fear.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You have five seconds to explain yourself, before I slit your pretty... little... throat."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I didn’t flinch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I told you. I’m the Hero of Time," I said, voice hoarse but unwavering. "So either end it, or believe me. I don’t care anymore."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The blade trembled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And for a heartbeat... so did she.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Kotake grunted, muttered something under her breath, and slid the dagger back into the folds of her robe. Her bulbous yellowed eyes remained fixed on me, silent, calculating. Then, like a dam cracking all at once, she threw her head back and burst into laughter—loud, shrill, and deeply amused.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Hahaha! Oh, by the sands, I was starting to think the potion had soured, but it's true! </span>
      <span class="c4">Truly</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> true! The great Link, Hero of Time, terror of witches and monsters alike, reduced to a scrawny slip of a flower petal! Oh, the irony! The symmetry! The sheer </span>
      <span class="c4">poetry</span>
      <span class="c0">!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She cackled until her breath wheezed. "You and your mirror-shining bravery gave Koume and I nightmares for years, you know. But now? Hah! Look at you. Stripped bare, bandaged, whimpering in my hut like a half-drowned cucco. Heeheehee!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She wiped a tear from one eye, still shaking with mirth. I turned away, flushed with shame and fury, biting the inside of my cheek to keep from screaming.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Oh yes, </span>
      <span class="c4">hardee har har</span>
      <span class="c0">!" I snapped, voice tight. "Why not just kill me already? Take your revenge for your son, or your pride, or whatever’s left of your ego. I’m right here. Go on."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I tried to cross my arms, but pain spiked through my shoulder and I hissed through gritted teeth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Kill you?" Kotake scoffed, waving a gnarled hand. "Child, you're managing that feat just fine on your own. No, I don’t want you dead. Not yet. If anything, I ought to </span>
      <span class="c4">thank</span>
      <span class="c0"> you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Her voice dropped lower.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"You helped open our eyes. Ganondorf—he was going to use us. Just as he used the rest of the tribe. We saw it too late to stop him, but early enough to flee. Koume and I, we’re not </span>
      <span class="c4">evil</span>
      <span class="c7 c6">, girl. We protected our people. We kept them alive when your Hylian kings tried to </span>
      <span class="c4">erase</span>
      <span class="c0"> us."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She stepped away, voice calmer now but no less firm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"History forgets that, doesn’t it? Your royal family tried to wipe out the Gerudo after the Great Wars. Burned our temples. Buried our daughters. But of course, to the hero, we’re just wicked witches in the dark."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She chuckled bitterly, then waved a hand dismissively. "But enough of that. Political ramblings are wasted on ears still soft from fairy songs."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My jaw clenched. The shame burned hotter now—not just at her laughter, but at the truth I didn’t know how to face. No one ever talked about the other side of the fence… but her words made a kind of uncomfortable sense.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Umm, okay? So if you aren't evil, why did you flee to Termina?" I asked, trying to keep the edge in my voice. "Surely you could’ve stayed and helped the Guard capture Ganondorf. Running only makes you look guilty."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Kotake scoffed, her mouth twisting into something that might’ve once been a smile. "You may be the former Hero of Time, but you’re still a daft, clueless child. Had we stayed, the King's Guard would’ve done to us what they did to the rest of our sisters—imprisoned us, tortured us, and strung us up like warnings."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My lips parted in protest. "No. That can’t be right. The king wouldn’t allow something like that. He would’ve shown mercy. Unlike your people, who nearly destroyed the kingdom! We restored Hyrule. We—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"—You </span>
      <span class="c4">restored</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> nothing," Kotake snapped, eyes flaring. "You buried what made it </span>
      <span class="c4">honest</span>
      <span class="c7 c6">. The Royal Family enslaved the races to serve their glory—Gorons in the mines, Zora in the reservoirs, Gerudo in the margins. That’s what started the Great Wars, girl. Your </span>
      <span class="c4">noble line</span>
      <span class="c0"> forced loyalty through blood and blade. If not for your precious ‘goddess’ shielding your people, the Hylians would have crumbled under the weight of their own greed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She leaned close, voice low and sharp. "The only reason your race still exists is because you're the so-called 'Blessed of Hylia.' Keep that in mind the next time you think yourself a savior."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And with that, she rapped her jeweled knuckle sharply against my forehead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ow—hey!" I winced, recoiling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Now hush," she muttered, shuffling back toward her table.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I sat in sullen silence, rubbing the sore spot. Her words throbbed louder than the sting on my head. And disturbingly... they didn’t feel entirely wrong. The stories I was raised on never mentioned chains in the mines or drowned songs in the Zora halls.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I turned to apologize—but then my eyes caught on the half-empty flask on the table.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The potion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">A shiver of suspicion curled through me. What if it hadn’t just made me speak the truth? What if it was twisting my thoughts? Making me question the truths I </span>
      <span class="c4">knew</span>
      <span class="c0">?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stiffened. "Ugh, you can’t brainwash me with that weird potion. I’m not so easily corrupted!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I jabbed a finger at her. "And my people have always been good to the land and its subjects. It’s </span>
      <span class="c4">you</span>
      <span class="c0"> and your ilk who spread poison, who summon monsters, who cause all the trouble—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Kotake slowly turned back, one brow raised. Her grin returned—but it had no warmth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Oh, child. If I had intended to corrupt you, you wouldn’t be </span>
      <span class="c4">arguing</span>
      <span class="c0"> with me right now. You’d be agreeing. You’d be smiling."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Her gaze flicked to the flask.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That potion didn’t change your mind, dear girl. It just quieted your fear long enough to hear the truth."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I looked away, heat blooming in my cheeks again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Because the worst part was… some stubborn part of me feared she might be right.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I let out a long breath and sank into the mat, the tension in my muscles giving way to exhaustion. Whatever her past, whatever she said about Hylians or the wars, one truth remained: she had saved me. She had saved </span>
      <span class="c4">us</span>
      <span class="c0">. And for that, I owed her at least a sliver of gratitude.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Look... despite all that, you still went out of your way to rescue us. And I guess... whether you're trying to brainwash me or not, I need to thank you. For saving our lives."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Kotake waved a hand as if brushing off a speck of dust. "Well, it’s what I </span>
      <span class="c4">do</span>
      <span class="c0">. People come from all over Termina to seek my skills and potions. And for the record, I merely gave you a truth tonic. I have no use for a weak twit like you to be a slave anyway."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">My eyes snapped toward her. "Wait—</span>
      <span class="c4">truth</span>
      <span class="c0"> tonic?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Of course," she said breezily, already turning toward her shelves. "You never know what kind of snake slithers in from the swamplands. And </span>
      <span class="c4">you</span>
      <span class="c0">—carrying the Bow of Light of all things—I needed to be sure."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I narrowed my eyes. "So you </span>
      <span class="c4">drugged</span>
      <span class="c0"> me. That’s what you’re saying."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"I </span>
      <span class="c4">protected</span>
      <span class="c0"> myself. You’re lucky that’s all I did."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I huffed and slumped back, flicking my crimson bangs from my eyes with a sharp motion. "Well, now you know who I am. I’m just the great Hero of Time, defeated and cursed into this stupid form by a bratty Skull Kid. Congratulations."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Kotake hummed, her grin fading into something more thoughtful. "Masked Skull Kid, you say? Ah yes, Koume’s been complaining about strange energies rising in the swamp. But I didn’t imagine </span>
      <span class="c4">that</span>
      <span class="c0"> was the cause. That runt’s been meddling in everyone's business for years, but something this vast..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She trailed off, muttering to herself as she shuffled through a curtain of beaded vines.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">When she returned, she held a glass vial filled with a shimmering red liquid. The light caught it like a flame, casting soft ruby flickers along the walls.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Alright, Missy. Drink this—it’ll mend the damage to your body and restore your strength. I already gave a drop to your fairy friend, so she should be fluttering awake soon."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She caught my hesitation immediately and raised a bushy brow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, it’s not poisoned. No, it won’t make you sprout a third eye or worship frogs. Just drink it. I wouldn’t waste good ingredients on a corpse. And besides..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Her eyes glinted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"I have a </span>
      <span class="c4">favor</span>
      <span class="c0"> to ask of you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c20">
      <span class="c0"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She handed me the vial, and I took it reluctantly, the glass warm from her palm. Popping the tiny cork free, I brought it to my nose and recoiled instantly—the scent was like fermented mushrooms and singed wood. Grimacing, I shut my eyes and tilted the red potion back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The liquid hit my tongue like fire-drenched syrup—sickly sweet, then bitter, then sour. I gagged and forced it down, shuddering with each thick gulp until the last drop slid down my throat. I sat there a moment, quivering in disgust.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"There you go," Kotake said, watching with something close to amusement. "Now just lay back down and don't move while I tend to your friend."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I set the empty vial beside me, then slowly reclined against the mat, letting my body sink into the faint warmth spreading through my chest and side. My fingers tingled. The sharp ache in my shoulder began to dull, replaced by a soothing hum that flowed down my arm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Kotake shuffled to a blackened fireplace at the far end of the room. A squat cauldron bubbled over orange flames, filling the space with the thick scent of earth and iron. Tatl lay nearby, still unconscious, curled in a shallow wooden box lined with moss and silk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The witch ladled some of the cauldron’s dark brew into a stone bowl. As she stirred it with a gnarled stick, I watched her closely, uncertain if this was more magic or medicine—or both. A flicker of blue light pulsed faintly along the rim of the bowl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The healing potion surged through me again, and I gasped softly as I felt my muscles knit, the raw pull of my shoulder easing further. Fingers I hadn’t realized were numb slowly curled again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Kotake walked over to Tatl and, with unexpected gentleness, sprinkled a black, shimmering powder over her delicate form. Her voice dipped into a low murmur, words in a language I didn’t understand curling through the air like smoke.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">When she returned, she looked almost… tired.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Alrighty then, your arm should be healed for the most part. Why don’t you stand up and dress yourself. Then we can discuss my payment for saving your life."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hmph… I guess that’s fair," I muttered, pushing myself upright with a wince. My legs were stiff, my balance unsteady, but the pain had mostly ebbed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I glanced back toward Tatl, her glow now faint but steady.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What did you just sprinkle onto her?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Kotake grinned, not unkindly. "Still don’t trust me, eh? Hehe, well I suppose that’s wise. I dusted her with something to draw the poison out and nullify its effects. Nothing dangerous. Just a little shadowroot and moon ash. Ancient remedies."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She winked, and I wasn’t sure if it was meant to reassure me—or unsettle me more.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As I trudged toward my hanging garments, still clutching the scratchy blanket around me, Kotake clucked and snorted, amusement glittering in her bugged-out eyes. She leaned on her stick like it was a throne, watching me with a predator’s patience.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Tsk tsk. You needn't be so modest," she said with theatrical exasperation. "There’s nothing to hide. I had to undress you, you know?" She chuckled, the sound dry as sand scraping stone. "As a former Gerudo matron, I’ve seen more naked women than you’ll ever </span>
      <span class="c4">meet</span>
      <span class="c0">, hehehe. You should be proud of your form if nothing else—most of them would, and have, killed to own such a lovely body!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I scowled as I reached for my tunic. "This is a cursed body, remember? Why would I enjoy it? The whole reason I’m stuck in this world is to </span>
      <span class="c4">undo</span>
      <span class="c0"> this ridiculous spell."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, I’m sure," Kotake said with maddening cheer, her voice rising in sing-song mockery. A knowing gleam danced in her eyes like firelight flickering over oil.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I hesitated, glancing at my reflection faintly mirrored in a polished copper cauldron. My feminine face—rounder, softer, still unfamiliar—stared back at me with a confused mix of strength and fragility. There were smudges of ash on my cheek, a lock of red hair stuck to my damp temple. I sighed and grumpily pulled the dark brown tunic over my breasts. The neckline was lower than I remembered without the cloak covering it, and still showed off more than I would've liked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Look... my situation’s none of your business. Not to sound ungrateful," I muttered, fumbling with the cloth wrapping around my chest. "But every time I catch a glimpse of myself like </span>
      <span class="c4">this</span>
      <span class="c0">, I’m reminded I can never go back. I’m supposed to be a warrior. Not some damsel in distress."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The words tumbled out before I could stop them—ripped from the tight place in my chest. That truth tonic still clung to my tongue like oil, loosening truths I hadn’t meant to share.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Then I realized—</span>
      <span class="c4">goddesses</span>
      <span class="c0">, I was still naked below the waist. And Kotake was watching. Her grin widened, toothy and unrepentant.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Heat rushed to my ears. I lunged for my clothing, pulling on new underwear with frenzied urgency, followed by my dark green cloak and fingerless gloves. The bra still lay on the ground like an abandoned challenge. I scowled at it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"And then there's this stupid thing... how the hell do you get used to wearing this stuff??"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Kotake clucked like an annoyed hen and shuffled over to me, picking up the tan bra with exaggerated disdain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Honestly, you are worse than a child..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">With surprising strength, the hag spun me around, stripped off my cloak and tunic in a swift motion, and expertly wrapped the bra around my chest, adjusting the cups so my breasts settled into them properly. Her hands were quick and precise, like someone who had done this a thousand times.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You're gonna have to get used to it eventually, girly! Heheheh..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I groaned as she stepped back. I bent down to pull on my deerskin boots and grabbed my sturdy gear belt from its peg. The leather was worn smooth in familiar places—finger-hollows, notches, the faint scent of wind and sweat and battle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The weight of it grounded me. I strapped it around my waist and pulled on my boots with trembling fingers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Last, I reached for the blue bow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Its weight in my hands stilled the storm. I tested the silver drawstring, felt the tension vibrate through my fingertips like a quiet song. It was solid. Real. </span>
      <span class="c4 c12">Mine.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'll never get used to this. I was the goddess-damned Hero of Time. And now—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Oh posh!" Kotake interrupted. "You sound more like a spoiled little princess than a fallen hero. Your </span>
      <span class="c4">curse</span>
      <span class="c0">—pah! I’ve seen men turned inside-out, children hexed to live as shadows. You’ve got skin, breath, will. Be thankful, you foolish girl."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She thumped me on the head with her stick again—more gently this time, though it still stung.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Now, if you're quite finished bellyaching, I need you to fetch my sister."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Ouch! Would you </span>
      <span class="c4">please</span>
      <span class="c0"> stop hitting me?!" I snapped, batting the stick aside and rubbing the sore spot. My ears burned hotter than ever.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The crone only snickered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'm simply trying to instill some sense into that addled brain of yours, you pansy. But are you going to sit there and moan or be on your way to find Koume?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Urrghhh… that was actually the only reason we came this way," I admitted, rubbing the back of my neck. "Frank, the Tour Guide, said she was missing. And we need a boat to go deeper into the swamp."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Eh? </span>
      <span class="c4">Deeper</span>
      <span class="c0">?" The witch croaked in disbelief. "Why on earth would you wish to go further in? You barely survived here on the outskirts!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ha, I'm not as helpless as you think—watch this..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I reached behind my belt for the familiar weight of my mask.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My fingers grasped at air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Panic gripped my chest like a vice. I patted my belt, checked my cloak, searched every pouch. Nothing. My breathing quickened as I dropped to the floor, shoving aside furs and satchels in frantic desperation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Watch what? If I wanted to see hysterical floundering, I'd throw a fish onto dry land!" Kotake scoffed. "What in the realms are you looking for now?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"My mask! Where is my mask?!" I cried, voice cracking. "I just had it! No, no, no—this can’t be happening!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Mask? I didn’t see anything like that on you, or anywhere near when I found you," she said, squinting. "Why are you so agitated over a silly trinket?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"It’s not silly! That mask contains the last of my spirit! If I can’t find it, I’ll never turn back—never be myself again!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My eyes darted wildly around the hut, scanning corners, nooks, under rugs and behind baskets.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Kotake rubbed her chin, expression souring. "Hmm… a very interesting way of preserving spirits. Primitive, but clever. Still, stop flitting your eyes around like a startled cucco. I told you—I don’t have it. You most likely dropped it when Odalwa attacked you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stumbled onto a nearby stool, holding my head in my gloved hands.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Gods... I'm going to be a girl forever…" I moaned, my voice muffled by my palms.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Oh, stop your incessant moping! You're worse than a newborn babe! If your precious mask is missing, </span>
      <span class="c4">go find it</span>
      <span class="c0">! It's likely still in the area where the monster ambushed you, you soft-brained twit!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She stormed over, her stick tapping sharply on the floor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Get up. Find your mask. And find my sister. Your fairy stays here with me as collateral until you return."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I blinked up at her. "But what about Odalwa? I doubt I’d get very far before it found me again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hmph… I already considered that," Kotake grumbled, fishing in the folds of her robe. She produced a smooth, flat stone no larger than a coin, etched with faded runes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"This is a charm I crafted while you were unconscious. It will keep the monster from sensing your presence. With it, you won't be hunted—unless you’re foolish enough to draw attention again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I took the charm from her wrinkled hand, turning it over in my palm. The grey stone was cool, faintly humming. A tiny, blood-red ruby gleamed at its center, surrounded by flecks of deep purple that shimmered like ink in water. A looped piece of thread was securely wrapped around the charm, effectively creating a necklace.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I exhaled slowly, steadying my nerves. One step at a time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Thanks... I guess."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Kotake gave me a sideways grin. "You're welcome. Now get going before I change my mind and keep your bow too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I pulled the amulet over my head, flipping my hair out of the way, and stood. The charm settled against my chest with a gentle thud, its pulse faint but steady—like a quiet heartbeat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Okay, this is good… umm... do you think you know where Koume might be?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Last I heard, she said she needed to find yantam bark for boat repair. That particular tree only grows in the Shrouded Fens." Kotake waved her hands with exaggerated mystery, her fingers leaving faint trails in the air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Great, but how do I get there?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Phah! So many questions! It’s right down the path behind my hut. There’s a fallen, hollowed-out tree stump that serves as the entrance. Now run along, your fairy friend still needs careful attention. If she wakes before you get back, I’ll let her know you’ve become my errand girl, hehehehe!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I rolled my eyes and turned away, stomping out the door. Her laughter followed me like a swarm of buzzing insects. As much as her teasing grated on my nerves, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Kotake—however irritating—meant well.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The hut was perched high on a wooden platform built into the thick trunk of an ancient tree. As I stepped outside, the cool air of early dawn greeted me, carrying the scent of dew and distant wildflowers. I stumbled slightly, catching myself before I toppled off the edge. Below, the swamp glistened with a sheen of early light.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A steep ladder rested against the platform’s rim. I scanned the canopy, ensuring no monsters lurked nearby, then descended cautiously. My boots hit the lower platform with a dull thud.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Below, a purified spring wound gently around the base of the tree. The water shimmered silver-blue in the light—pure, untarnished, and sweet-smelling. A welcome contrast to the miasma that clung to most of the Southern Swamp.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I circled the trunk, the amulet pressing cool and comforting against my skin. Just as the witch said, a stone path nestled behind the roots, partially concealed by overgrowth. A series of stepping stones crossed the spring. I leapt to the nearest one, water splashing softly beneath me, then bounded across to the other side.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I sauntered onto the path, the misty morning air clinging to my skin. The calls of waking birds echoed through the trees, and the faint gurgle of the spring followed me like a song.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">But without Tatl beside me, the silence felt deeper. Heavier.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Don’t worry, Tatl," I muttered, glancing back toward the tree-bound hut. "I’ll be back soon."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I turned away, squaring my shoulders. Sunlight streamed in golden shafts through the leaves ahead, slicing through the morning fog.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Okay, Link, just keep moving and everything will be fine... You’ve been through far worse before. This is nothing."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I nodded to myself, gripped the amulet tightly, and stepped into the waiting trees—where shadow and silence were already beginning to rise.</span>

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c9 c16 c33">
        <br/>
      </span>
      <span class="c2">The stone pathway was fairly simple to follow, compared to the rest of the swamp's trails. I felt a nervous urgency pulse through me with each step, allowing me to make excellent headway. Rays of morning light danced through the pale mists as the sun slowly rose over the treetops, but despite the calm morning I knew there was little time to waste. The northern skies were almost completely blocked by the moon, its face glaring pure hatred at the world below.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A faint tremor rumbled in the distance, warning of the doom and destruction soon to come. Worse still, my mask was missing, and if I didn't find it soon I feared that all hope of ever returning to normal would be lost. Should my mask be destroyed, my spirit would go with it, and I'd be trapped like this forever.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Choosing to focus on the task at hand, I jogged down the path. The soft footfalls of my light boots pattered on the hard rock surface, each step echoing like a heartbeat in the quiet forest. The air was thick with moisture and the tang of loam, and pale beams of light lanced through gaps in the mist-shrouded canopy. Though birds chirped softly in the distance, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off—like the entire forest was holding its breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I scanned the woods around me for movement, my grip tightening on the bow at my side. I had an unsettling sense that something was watching me from beyond the veil of trees, unseen eyes tracking every step. Still, I pressed on, alert and silent, each motion measured. The gem-studded medallion swinging from my neck—Kotake’s charm—glinted dully in the filtered sunlight. It was supposed to keep Odalwa from hunting me. I prayed the witch had been truthful. I couldn’t fight that thing again—not in my current state.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Eventually, the path ended at the foot of a steep cliff wall. A massive, hollowed-out trunk of a fallen tree lay embedded in the stone, serving as a natural tunnel through the rock barrier. Dense fog rolled from within its dark maw, thick and pale, spilling over gnarled roots like spectral breath. I couldn’t see the far side—it was swallowed by haze.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">That same prickle of being watched crept back along my spine. My fingers curled instinctively around the grip of my bow, but I forced myself to move casually. If something was waiting for me, I didn’t want to give it the satisfaction of fear.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">With a deep breath, I stepped inside.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The tunnel was silent—eerily so. My boots thudded dully on damp wood as I crept forward, every sense on edge. The air smelled like moss and wet bark, and the fog curled around my legs like a living thing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I emerged on the far side into a world blanketed in silver mist. The Shrouded Fens stretched before me, a swamp cloaked in secrecy. The trees here were taller, darker, and seemed to lean in toward one another like conspirators. I could barely see more than a few paces ahead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I understood now why it was called the Shrouded Fens.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Everything here was hidden. And something, I knew, was still watching.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c20">
      <span class="c2"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I shuffled forward, taking care to watch my step, the wet ground muffling my footsteps beneath the thick fog. I squinted into the white haze, trying to make out shapes beyond the immediate blur. A vague rounded silhouette began to take form, dim and uncertain at first, but gradually sharpening into the outline of another hollowed-out tree trunk. The damp wood loomed like a mouth in the mist.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I stepped through it, waving the fog away with one arm as I passed into the gloom—and froze.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I was back at the entrance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh great! Another Lost Woods…" I groaned aloud, throwing my hands up. My voice echoed dully, swallowed quickly by the wet air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I looked up at the sheer cliff face nearby, hoping to spot a path upward where I could get a better view of the surroundings. But before I could move, a soft thud landed just behind me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I spun around, heart lurching.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A white monkey stood there, its fur ghostlike against the haze, large black eyes fixed curiously on me. Its little chest heaved with gentle breaths, and for a heartbeat we simply stared at one another.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Then it hopped forward, motioning with its paw toward the trunk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Mmm… This way... follow!" the monkey grunted in a strange, halting voice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I blinked. "W-wait! You guys can talk?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yes. Follow... mmm," it repeated, then turned and bounded into the tunnel without looking back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Still stunned, I hesitated—then shook off the surprise and broke into a jog. My boots made soft clops along the old wood as I ran. I didn’t want to lose sight of the small creature—not in this swirling white maze.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The monkey led me through a series of identical tunnels, each one swallowing us into another fog-drenched passage. The air grew damper, thicker, and the wooden walls echoed with my breath and the faint patter of the monkey’s nimble feet. Between the fog and the twisting corridors, it was a miracle the creature didn’t lose its way.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">After what felt like an endless chase through fog and twisting trunks, we passed through the last tunnel—and suddenly, the miasma lifted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Before us stretched a grove unlike anything I'd seen before. Odd, brightly colored trees burst from the swamp floor, their trunks painted in reds and deep blues that shimmered in the misty light. Their bark looked smooth and velvety, like brushed suede, and large, juicy-looking orange fruit hung from low, swooping branches like lanterns on a festival night. The scent here shifted too—faintly sweet and oddly floral, as if the air itself were laced with nectar.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The monkey scuttled ahead without pause, disappearing behind one of the larger trees. I followed, half-wary, half-curious, until we stopped abruptly before a bizarre, humanoid-shaped shrub.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">It looked almost sculpted—too symmetrical to be natural—with leafy arms curved like hips and a knotted, angular face formed from bark and foliage. As I stepped closer, something glittered at the top of the figure: a shiny red gem, embedded like a crown.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">And then, the plant moved.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Are you going to stand there all day gawking at me, you twit? Or are you going to help me out here?" the shrub bellowed in a voice both shrill and imperious, its leafy limbs flailing like offended arms.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I staggered back with a yelp. "I… ummm… I’m sorry? What, uh, what do you need? Water?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No, you dolt! I’m not a plant!" the creature snapped, rattling with indignation. "Why don’t you do something useful and fetch my sister, Kotake? She’ll know what to do."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">My brain scrambled to keep up. "Wait. You’re Koume? I guess I should’ve seen that one coming... What happened to you?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The foliage shifted as the shrub seemed to deflate with a tired huff. "How did you know my name? I’ve never seen you before!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You mentioned Kotake," I muttered, still staring in disbelief.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Bah, no matter! Some impetuous Skull Kid wearing a mask ambushed me while I was gathering supplies. Caught me off guard. The little devil turned me into a plant! A plant, of all things! Do I look like a geranium to you?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmph, I know how you feel. I've had my fill of Skull Kid and his curses myself... Oh wait!" I blinked, realization striking like lightning, and reached for my ocarina, plucking it from my pouch with trembling hands. "I think I know just what to do."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Koume's leafy brow furrowed. "Hey… That instrument right there, somehow it looks... very familiar. Like something I've only dreamed about in—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I didn’t give her a chance to finish. I brought the ocarina to my lips and began to play the Song of Healing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The first few notes drifted into the grove like wind through reeds—soft, sacred, and strange. The melody shimmered in the heavy air, and the trees themselves seemed to lean in to listen. Koume began to glow, her leafy form pulsing with a pale, ethereal light.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The monkey that had guided me screeched in sudden terror, leaping up a tree and vanishing into the canopy with a rustle of leaves. Light burst from Koume’s chest, flaring bright white as the song reached its crescendo.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Whaa?! What's going on here?!" Koume shouted, her voice rising in pitch as her body dissolved into golden particles.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The brightness swallowed her, consuming the foliage until it collapsed in on itself like mist in sunlight. Her cries were lost beneath the swelling chords, the grove bathed in a soothing, mystical hum.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">As the last note rang out and the light dimmed, Koume reappeared—whole, human, and utterly flabbergasted. Her tiny, wrinkled form stood dazed in the sunlight, mouth agape and robes slightly askew.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I lowered the ocarina and slipped it back into my pouch, exhaling with relief.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Phew... I’m glad that actually worked. Hah!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Koume glanced down at herself, inspecting her hands, her feet, even tugging at a strand of her hair as if confirming it wasn’t made of moss. At her feet lay a Deku-shaped mask—wooden, gnarled, and now lifeless. She kicked it aside with a huff of disdain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Then she whirled on me, hobbling forward on her stubby legs with surprising speed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Who... are you?? Where did you get that instrument?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Look… It's a long story. I'm sure if you get back to your sister she'll tell you all about it. But everyone seems to be worried about you… it would probably be best if you let them know you're OK."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh my! You're right, Kotake must be worried sick!" Koume snapped her fingers and a rickety broom appeared in a puff of smoke. "Thank you most graciously, child! Shall I give you a ride back to my sister's shop?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Umm… no thanks. I've still got something I really need to look for." I politely declined, still aiming to locate my mask before the moon fell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Meh, suit yourself. Come by the boathouse sometime, I'll give you a free ride on one of my fancier ships." The fiery witch hopped on her broom with a surprisingly agile flip and sped off into the sky, sparks and embers trailing behind her. "Hehehe! Koume is revived!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I stood alone again in the strange grove, quiet now except for the rustling leaves and the faint whistle of wind through the red-and-blue trees. I walked toward the mask Koume had kicked aside. A flicker of hesitation tugged at my gut—part awe, part dread. What power still clung to it? What might it do to me if I dared to wear it?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Its features were eerily lifelike: a protruding hollow snout, beady red eyes, and stiff green leaf-like fronds for hair. It looked like a warped Deku face carved out of living wood, expression frozen in wide-eyed surprise. The edges were rough, almost alive, and the whole thing seemed to hum faintly with leftover magic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I didn’t dare put it on. Not after everything. I’d had my fill of cursed masks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmm...maybe I could ask Kotake to look at this for me," I murmured, slipping the strange mask behind my belt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I turned and made my way back the way I’d come, stepping through the large tunnel, its interior swallowed in a dense, curling mist that clung to my boots and crept along the ground like a living thing. My footsteps echoed faintly within the hollowed trunk, swallowed up almost immediately by the enchanted quiet. As I emerged from the other side at the Fens’ entrance, I let out a sigh and rolled my eyes at the trickery of the woods. The place pulsed with strange magic—it felt like stepping out of a dream that had forgotten its ending.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">But before I could take another step forward, a sudden rustle above made me freeze. Three monkeys sprang down from the trees with acrobatic grace, landing in my path in a tight semicircle. Their fur was damp with dew, and their sharp eyes glittered with recognition. I stumbled back slightly, startled, and instinctively drew my bow, pulling the string taut with a whisper of tension.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No no swordsman! We friends, we friends!" the middle monkey hooted, waving its arms wildly in alarm. Its voice was scratchy but urgent, thick with a jungle dialect that turned vowels into squeaks and consonants into chirps. "No shoot!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">My eyes widened. I hesitated a moment, then lowered the bow, letting out a slow breath as I returned the weapon to my back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey… you called me 'swordsman'! How did you know I’m a swordsman?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The monkey bounced on its feet, pointing animatedly. "We see you fight wolves! With mask! You brave. You avenge brother—bold! Eek eek! But you… you be under curse. Swamp curse too… very bad. You here to help us, eh? Yes?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Its speech was garbled, riddled with strange cadence and half-formed grammar, but the meaning came through clearly enough. They’d seen me. They knew more than I’d expected—and perhaps more than they should.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhhh... yeah, that's right. But... I lost my mask, and I can't defeat that monster without it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh!" The spokesmonkey turned toward the trees and hooted, waving for something to join the group. "We see you drop while you attacked by ancient curse terror! Mmm... We protect!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A large gray monkey, bulkier than the others and nearly as tall as me, lumbered out of the dense underbrush. Cradled carefully in its thick-fingered hands was my mask—its</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">carved features bold and resolute, even beneath a layer of grime. My heart leapt into my throat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You guys... found it?" I gasped, running up to the larger monkey and nearly snatching it from his hands in relief. I let out a cry of joy, clutching the familiar artifact to my chest. "You protected it—for me? Thank you!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I bowed low in gratitude, a deep swell of amazement—and a twinge of guilt—tightening in my chest. They hadn’t owed me anything. Yet they’d watched over one of my most precious possessions.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"How can I repay your kindness?" I asked, still clutching the mask to my chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No pay," the spokesmonkey declared with a shake of his head. "We help you defeat terror! We want home tree back! We want prince back! Deku take prince—blame him for missing Deku princess! Help!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The monkey suddenly burst into frantic chatter, the others joining in a synchronized explosion of screeches and tail-thrashing. They leapt and bounded around me in chaotic arcs of fur and sound.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Whoa, whoa, hold it! I’ll help you guys, just quiet down before something hears you!" I shouted over the din, waving my hands above my head to calm them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">At the command of a sharp caw from the leader, the others froze mid-bounce and settled, twitching with barely restrained energy. The lead monkey stepped forward again, his large eyes now filled with quiet sorrow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Prince being held in Deku Palace... south edge of swamp," he said solemnly. "Must hurry now. They punishing prince... very bad."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">With that final word, they dashed off, vanishing into the shifting curtain of trees and mist. Though peculiar, the monkeys clearly understood the swamp's dangers far better than most—and they had returned something precious to me. At the very least, I owed them. If their prince was being punished unjustly, I would see him freed. But first, I needed to return to Tatl and check in at Kotake’s shop.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I glanced up at the sky, the sun now rising higher above the treeline, spilling golden light over the dense canopy. Judging by the angle of its ascent, it was already mid-morning. The brilliant azure sky was a painful contrast to the looming black moon still dominating the northern horizon, a grotesque reminder of the ticking clock above. There wasn’t much time left, and I doubted I could find Odolwa’s lair on foot before the world was crushed beneath that leering celestial face. There had to be a faster way to get around. Some shortcut. Some trick.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Sighing, I secured my recovered mask to my belt alongside the strange Deku one, and took off at a steady jog down the stone trail. A quiet sense of triumph bubbled up inside me. I had completed my tasks without losing my life, and I owed that to the strange tribe of monkeys who had protected what I had lost. Without them, I’d have been just another victim swallowed by the swamp’s creeping decay. And if they needed help, well... saving a prince sounded simple enough. The Deku had never posed much of a threat before—not to someone with a shield and decent reflexes. With my mask restored, the odds were finally tilting in my favor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The twisted silhouette of Kotake’s crooked-roof shop came into view as I rounded the final bend. Colorful smoke curled from its chimney like incense from a cauldron, swirling in purples and sickly greens above the treetops. I paused, a mischievous grin curling my lips as I recalled Kotake’s endless jabs and jeers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Oh, she was going to </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">love</span>
      <span class="c2"> this.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I plucked the Hero’s Mask from my belt and pressed it to my face. The transformation struck like a thunderclap through water—searing heat and icy tension wrapping around my frame as my muscles writhed, bones grinding into new shapes, sinew pulling tight across a form not wholly mine. I gasped, my vision flashing white for a breathless moment as the magic scalded through every nerve.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">It was painful—always—but familiar now. Almost comforting. Like slipping into a battle-worn coat that still bore the scent of home.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">As the shift settled, I blinked against the sharp clarity of my restored senses. Colors seemed deeper. Edges more defined. Strength returned to my limbs like a tide rolling in.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I stepped up onto the platform, boots thudding softly against the planks, and climbed the creaking ladder two rungs at a time. The scent of moss, smoke, and potion oil drifted from the crooked little house ahead, curling through the morning air like old secrets.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Still smirking—half from triumph, half from the mischief I planned—I reached for the handle and pushed the door open.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'm back!" I gruffly called into the hut. "Where's Tatl?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Koume and Kotake were in the middle of a conversation when I thudded through the door, and both shrieked at the sight of me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"It's him... the Hero, Kotake! He found us, what now?!" Koume panicked, backing up against the back wall.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No wait! It's an illusion, or a spirit!" Kotake snapped, eyes narrowing with suspicion. "The hero was transformed into some petulant girl! Should we banish this ghost into oblivion?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yes, let's finish it quickly! The mere sight of it will haunt my dreams tonight!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Koume burst into flame, heat rippling off her form in waves of shimmering distortion, while Kotake became encased in mobile frost, jagged shards skating over her arms as she raised them. I quickly raised my hands, waving them frantically.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey hey! Wait, it's me! Do you want to destroy your hom—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Too late. Their twin spells collided midair, forming a cyclone of elemental force that slammed into my chest like a battering ram. The impact knocked the wind from my lungs and flung me backward into the closed door, which rattled against its hinges.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A searing pain spread through my ribs as I crumpled, the Hero's mask dislodging from my face mid-fall.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">And then—</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The change hit me like an explosion inward. My limbs shrank, bones twisting and reshaping with sickening cracks. Muscles contorted, pulled taut like strings, then released in shuddering relief. My torso cinched inward; hips flared with a sharp crack. My voice cracked into a short, strangled gasp as the last remnants of my former shape rebounded into something smaller, rounder—feminine yet again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I lay face-down, fingers trembling against the cool wooden flooring, gasping as the storm inside my body quieted. The mask rolled across the floor, coming to rest beside me, its surface glinting dully in the firelight. My tunic had ridden up in the blast, and my now-smaller frame left me swimming in its folds. A draft crept up my thighs as I weakly tried to tug it back down.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wait, Koume! Look, it's not a ghost. Hold your fire, you twit!" Kotake yelled out.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"It was only… </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">gasp</span>
      <span class="c2">... a joke!" </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I wheezed, trying to sit up as my voice cracked into a familiar feminine tone again. I paused, blinking. The pain wasn't nearly as bad from the transformation this time—just a flicker of heat in my chest, a soft pop of pressure in my hips. That flicker of unease returned. Was I... getting used to this? I looked to the mask that had fallen beside me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"And how… </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">pant</span>
      <span class="c2">... did you knock my mask off?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Koume extinguished herself with a dramatic puff of steam, peering at me like I was a curiosity pinned in a display case.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"What in all the sacred springs... Kotake, did we hit him so hard he changed species?!" Koume squawked. "He’s a girl now! A </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">girl</span>
      <span class="c2">! Spirits and shadows, that’s a first even for me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I told you that wasn’t a spirit, you daft cucumber," Kotake snapped, thumping Koume on the head with her mixing stick.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ow! Don’t smack me with that thing! The real Hero couldn’t possibly be here, so how was I supposed to know it wasn’t some ghostly projection?!" Koume snapped back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"S-stop it, you two!" I barked, my voice breaking as I dragged myself upright with trembling arms. My limbs felt like soaked parchment—fragile and weak. My breath hitched, and my chest heaved as I fought to steady it. My face burned with a mix of shame and disbelief—flustered from being caught off guard, from transforming so helplessly, from realizing that the very witches I'd once defeated at full strength had nearly flattened me with a single blast. "It’s... just me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Phah, you daft child! Why would you pull such an awful trick? And how did you cast that illusion?" Kotake demanded, arms crossed and eyebrow twitching.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No, look." I picked up the mask from the floor, brushing soot from its carved surface. "It’s the mask. It restores my real self—not an illusion, not a spell. Just... whatever this curse is."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Sarcasm dripped from Kotake's words as she answered. "Why my dear sister, this is the 'great and noble' Warrior of Time who tortured our slumber for nearly a decade. Only he's been cursed into this adorable little flower, hehe."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Truly?" Koume chortled only momentarily before becoming serious. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh. This one saved me from sharing a similar fate, so I must show my gratitude."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Similar fate? You're already a woman, you senile toad!" the icy witch mocked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Shut your gums, you vulture. A few days ago, a scrawny masked skull child came out of nowhere and ambushed me! Then the kid turned me into a plant, of all things!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So... that's why you went missing? You couldn't defend yourself even against a weak Skull Kid? I think you may have been more useful as a plant, hehehe. I—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Good gods, do both of you always quarrel like this?!" I snapped, throwing my arms up. My patience was already fraying at the seams. "Look, all I want is Tatl and a boat. Then I'll be out of your hair and you won’t have to deal with me ever again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh, right. Your impertinent little fairy friend…" Kotake muttered, rifling through her robes. Her fingers emerged holding a glass bottle with a glint of smug satisfaction. "She was getting uppity about you being gone and tried to escape the moment her strength returned. I had to… restrain her."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">She casually tossed the bottle to me. I caught it with a startled grunt, the glass cool and solid in my palm. Inside, Tatl whirled like a trapped star, her glow flaring with indignant fury. Tiny fists hammered against the transparent walls, lighting up the bottle like a lantern about to burst.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Without hesitation, I popped the cork. The moment the seal broke, Tatl erupted into the air like an angry comet, circling my head in a rapid blur of wings and righteous fury. Her voice—sharp, high, and relentless—unleashed a furious tirade in every direction.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"You maniacs bottled me?! Do you have </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">any</span>
      <span class="c2"> idea how humiliating that was?! I swear, if I were five times bigger—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I raised a hand slowly, gently pressing a finger to her tiny face mid-flight.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Shhh… it’s okay. We're alright now."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">She hovered there, wings buzzing like a nervous heartbeat. Her glow flickered—hot, then hesitant. Her mouth still opened in protest, but when her eyes met mine, something in them softened. The fury dimmed, and her whole frame gave a subtle shiver. She stayed close, breathing heavily, and slowly lowered herself. I nodded and offered the bottle back to the witches.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Kotake waved one gnarled hand dismissively. "No no, you keep it," she croaked. "You might be needing it for that one later on. I’ve no use for more bottles. Consider it a bonus for... uh, saving Koume in such a timely manner."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Her dry, crow-like cackle scratched the air, and Koume rolled her eyes with a tired groan.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl floated down to my shoulder and settled there with a reluctant sigh. Her glow pulsed a little softer now—dimmed, yes, but warmer. Grounded. We were together again. And that was enough for her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uh...thanks I guess. Oh, before I forget, I found this after I cured you." I produced the mask Koume had kicked aside earlier. "Could you by chance tell me anything about it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Kotake snatched the Deku mask from my hands with surprising speed. "Hmmmm, this smells strongly of magic…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The hag turned it over in her gnarled fingers, squinting at the carved visage. She brought it to her face and inhaled sharply through her oversized nose—the kind of exaggerated sniff one might expect from someone judging a rare wine at a banquet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'll need to run some tests," she muttered, still eyeing it carefully. "But judging by the smell—rich with loamy moss, sap, and something else... something spicy—I’d wager this gives the wearer some botanical traits. Maybe even allows them to interact with plantlife in strange ways."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You figured that out from a sniff?" I asked, incredulous.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Kotake tapped her enormous nose with pride. "This old thing could out-smell a swine and out-sniff a bloodhound. It's why my potions are so famously potent—I find only the finest, most fragrant ingredients."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Ha! You just </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">think</span>
      <span class="c2"> you can smell as well as you used to," Koume snorted. "Might I remind you that you're over four hundred years old? Your nose probably thinks soap is poison."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'm still younger than you, crag-face!" Kotake snapped back, brandishing the mask like a weapon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"As if! I was born after you, snag-tooth!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Spear-nose!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hog-back!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Sheesh, do you two ever stop fighting?!" I finally burst out, rubbing my temples. "And here you call </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">me</span>
      <span class="c2"> a stupid child when you’re both worse than toddlers! Gods help the swamp if I ever turn out like you two."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The bickering hags paused just long enough to glance at each other—and then cackled in unison.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c20">
      <span class="c2"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"There you see, Kotake? From the mouths of babes, wisdom seeps. Now then, I'll be the adult here and cease this ridiculous bickering," Koume snarked to Kotake before turning to face me. "I'll be at the boathouse—should you require a boat, come see me there."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Without another word, she summoned her broom with a snap of her fingers, opened the door with a lazy wave, and flew off in a swirl of herbal smoke.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmph... that nerve of Koume… Sometimes I swear she'll be the death of me," Kotake grumbled, more to herself than anyone. Then she turned her jaundiced gaze on me. "Anyhow, don’t you have somewhere to be right about now, little hero?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yes, actually. Now that I’ve got everything I need—at least for now—do you know where this Odalwa creature is hiding? I don’t have time to search blindly, not with the moon falling faster every second."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"This old bag doesn't know, Link," Tatl interjected flatly. "She doesn’t even know where it came from!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You know, for someone I just saved, you’re a rather ungrateful little maggot!" Kotake shot back, her voice rising with indignation. She turned to me with a sniff. "But no, I don’t know where the monster lives. I’d wager the Deku or Ape clans know more. Speaking of which... do you want this back?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">She held out the Deku Mask toward me, its carved features catching the dim light. I reached for it, hesitating just a heartbeat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So... you don’t think this will do more harm than good?" I asked, unease prickling my fingers. "I’m sick of cursed masks. Just holding this thing makes my skin crawl. I don’t trust it—not after what the last one did."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"How should I know? I’ve never dealt with this sort of thing before," Kotake scoffed, shrugging her robed shoulders. "Why don’t you just see for yourself?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Umm… maybe later. One transformation is enough for now." I glanced down at the mask, then tucked it away beside my own. "I dunno... Every time I change back to this, it’s like... something inside me gets pulled a little looser-"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link, we really need to go," Tatl cut in, tugging on the edge of my cloak. "As much as I love watching you chitchat with Granny over here, we still need to defeat that monster before the moon crushes everything."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah, yeah… I’m coming." I turned toward Kotake. "Thanks again for saving us. And... sorry for Tatl’s manners. We’ll get out of your hair now."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yes yes, just go," Kotake muttered. "And keep that medallion—I don’t want to hear about another fool getting dragged off by Odalwa!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">She waved her bony fingers toward the door. I nodded with a shallow bow and turned to leave, the medallion thudding gently against my chest like a second heartbeat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">As soon as we were outside, Tatl zipped around my head in a puff of indignant light.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Geez. Took you long enough! I can’t believe that witch actually put me in a bottle!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I gave a faint smirk, tucking the bottle she’d escaped into my pouch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well, now you know how fairies feel."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">She huffed again, but I caught the glint of a reluctant grin beneath her scowl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Knowing your attitude I don't blame her. You owe her your life, you know?" I scolded as I lightly stepped down the ladder. "You really should be thankful!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Well maybe I </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">would</span>
      <span class="c6"> be if she didn't </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">imprison</span>
      <span class="c2"> me!" Tatl snapped. "Anyway, what do we do next? And where were you this whole time?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">As we descended, I recounted the events—how the monkeys found me, how Koume had been turned into a shrub, and the strange power of the Song of Healing. Tatl listened in brooding silence until I mentioned the Deku Palace.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"There's no time for that, didn't you see the moon? We've only got a few hours, and you want to save this dungheap within that short span? No way. Play your ocarina and let’s go back to the first day!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"That wouldn't help. It took a whole day just to get here, remember?" I murmured, sliding down the final rungs of the ladder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"It's better than nothing. I don't think we'll get much further at this rate."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Okay, fine. I’ll think about it. If we don’t find something by nightfall, we’ll go back."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Tatl hovered close, wings twitching. "I'd rather not be here at night… with </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">that</span>
      <span class="c2"> devil... but you're the boss, I guess."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The midday sun filtered through the spanning canopy of wide, pronged leaves and long tangles of vines. The humid, motionless air weighed heavy on my shoulders, every breath thick with the scent of earth and decay. Still, we pressed on.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The midday sun filtered through the spanning canopy of wide, pronged leaves and long tangles of vines. The humid, motionless air weighed down my steps, but we traveled on quickly despite it. There was silence all around us and the atmosphere was tense, the kind of thick, oppressive quiet that made the hairs on my arms stand on end and my instincts twitch like a drawn bowstring. It's as if the entire swamp was on edge, preparing for the end of all things, and we hurried on our way back to the boathouse.</span>

      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We made our way through the humid wall within the tepid swamp. My muscles ached with fatigue, each step dragging with quiet resistance, and my breath came shallow and thin, tasting faintly of mildew and decay. A dull weight pressed behind my eyes—exhaustion mingling with a growing sense of urgency. Still, I pressed on, each step driven by the memory of what I had seen and what I had yet to face., both of us intent onA listening for any strange movement. The pools of water around us were still, and the dying foliage just as motionless. I carefully navigated around fallen logs, dead fauna, and pools of putrid liquid as we journeyed back to the boathouse.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"So what happened back there? Those witches seemed to... know you somehow?" Tatl chirped, breaking the sullen silence. "And where did you disappear off to, leaving me behind to deal with that ugly old hag? You know we hate being stuffed into bottles like that!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I went to find Koume, the one with the boats. And they were just… hmm… ghosts from my past and uh...future, I guess."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Well, they did say they would come back to haunt me… I silently mused.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ah… soooo you knew them back where you came from?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, not really. But I did sort of... kill them during my last adventure. Somehow they remembered, or saw their deaths through visions, and I guess it scared them enough into changing their ways."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I had a brief flashback with a firestorm of magic, of ice and flame spiraling together like twin comets smashing into the mirror-finished shield I found in that temple. I could still feel the chill and heat on my skin, the sound of Koume's voice twisted with rage, mixed with Kotake’s laughter echoing even as they fell. It was...a powerful memory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl paused mid-flight, confusion apparent on her tiny features as she analyzed my expression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Uhh... yeah nevermind, I don't wanna know anymore." She fluttered ahead, her confusion shifting to apprehension. "Why is everything so quiet around here? Yesterday the animals wouldn't shut up!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"It could be the moon, or Odalwa. This amulet Kotake gave me should protect us, though."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Uh huh. You said 'I should hear it coming' and 'don't worry'." Tatl whined, mimicking my voice in a high-pitched mockery. "Pfft, you should have just listened to me in the first place!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Shhhhh ok ok...enough, Tatl! Bickering will only attract unwanted attention." I scolded the snarky fairy. "Let's just focus on getting back to the boathouse."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"...fine… In any case, I hope that thing works. By the way, what's the story on that new mask on your belt?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh right, that. Skull Kid apparently turned Koume into some kind of plant, and I removed the curse by playing that song the mask salesman taught me. Then Koume was cured, and it just...appeared… just like my mask when I played the song for me." I produced the Deku mask and studied its features.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Why don't you try it on and see if it does anything?" Tatl pressed, tapping the tough wood with a tiny finger. "I'm sure you'll be fine."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No no, I'd rather not. I've had nothing but bad luck with these stupid masks, and I think it'd be in my best interest to leave this thing alone."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Something huge suddenly rustled the branches above, and rotted leaves drifted down from the canopy. Tatl and I froze. I slowly reached down to my mask. I was not going to be taken down so easily this time. Grabbing the mask, I pushed it to my face while leaping aside as the transformation took hold.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl zipped to my side as I rose to my feet, sword and shield drawn. When nothing else happened, I scanned the tree limbs above.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Do you think it was just a large bird?" I muttered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That didn’t sound like any bird I’ve ever seen… or heard. What if it’s another huge monster?" Tatl whispered anxiously.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Then I’ll take care of it. But it’s most likely one of those monkeys playing a joke. Still... let’s stay on guard."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We cautiously pressed forward along the obscure trail, and my boots splashed through puddles of algae-ridden mush as I kept one eye on the thick canopy. My hand never left the hilt of my blade.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl and I eventually reached our goal an hour or two later without further incident. Our tense pace had lengthened the journey, but the fairy’s sigh of relief at the lagoon’s edge was palpable.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I thought we were never going to make it back alive! But… you know... only for a second."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I smirked at her bravado as I stepped onto the floating dock leading to the boathouse. My limbs felt heavy, my steps dragging with growing fatigue. Tatl noticed and held out a tiny hand to stop me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Okay okay, you’re not invincible. You should probably take off that mask now. No need for it anymore, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I frowned, reluctant to part with the feeling of confident power—but nodded. I reached up and removed the mask. The shift hit like a crashing wave; heat surged through my veins, my limbs buckled as bone and sinew shrank. My hips flared sharply, my chest tightened, and a breath caught in my throat as it pitched higher. The weight of sword and shield vanished, and the eerie lightness that followed left me reeling. The wooden planks beneath my boots rocked with the sudden change, and I stumbled, catching myself on one knee as my long hair brushed against my cheek.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I exhaled shakily, heart pounding. No matter how many times it happened, the transformation never got easier. It wasn’t just the body that shifted—it was the reminder, the loss of what once felt like myself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Okay—cough cough—I'm alright... phew. Okay, let’s finally go get that boat."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl gave a soft nod, a flicker of pity in her glow. We started along the boardwalk. As we neared the door, it suddenly burst open—Frank charged out, arms wide.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I leapt back, heart hammering.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Krikey! Yew brought back m’ captain AND managed to survive!" the man boomed in delighted shock. "I truly underestimated the two o’ ya."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Uhhm yeah well…" I stammered, still startled. "We do what we can, right, Tatl?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl, who had darted into my cloak at Frank’s explosive entrance, didn’t respond.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Strewth… honestly, I was frettin’ I’d sent ya off to yer deaths on a bloody fool’s errand. Ye’ve no idea how glad I am to see ya right as rain!" Frank beamed, waving us inside. "Come on now, I still owe ya both a nice steamin’ cuppa. Koume’s waitin’ inside too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I followed him into the warm, oddly-decorated boathouse. Koume sat behind the counter, flipping through a worn book. Tatl cautiously emerged as Frank shut the door, then stomped over to the hearth to make tea.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ahh, so I see you made it back." Koume looked up casually. "I assume that means you want that boat ride, eh, little Hero?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey hey now, Koume! I owe these two some tea fer bringin ya back—don’t be rushin’ off just yet." Frank interrupted, holding up a hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I glanced at Tatl, who shrugged. Honestly, tea sounded great. My stomach growled loudly—I hadn’t eaten in days—and Frank chuckled knowingly at the sound.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"My my, now I know where all those earth shakes are coming from. Don’t you fret that rumbly tum of yours any longer, lil miss. I whipped up some fresh swamp cakes and gator bites to go with that tea—oughta patch you right up!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The big man began pouring scalding water into prepared cups from a teapot that appeared comically tiny in his enormous hands.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Um… </span>
      <span class="c4">gator bites</span>
      <span class="c0">? I've never really heard of those." I questioned the strange host.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh yeh, they're right scrumptious! Trust me, you'll gobble 'em right up."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl spoke up finally, exasperated and impatient. "Link, we really gotta get going! The moon is only hours away from falling and we haven't even made it to the Deku Palace yet!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Eh? So the moon really is falling?" Koume exclaimed, disregarding her book. "I just thought my eyes were going bad!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah, it's the Skull Kid's doing… and I'm the only one who can stop him. Only then will everything be back to normal, and I can get rid of this curse."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh right, yes. I keep forgetting. Did you try the little musical cure that you did for me?" Koume asked and leaned over the counter top.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Pfft, that only made things worse..." Tatl muttered before I could answer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Curses? Falling moons? What black rock have I been living under?" Frank bellowed as he set the cups of steaming liquid before Tatl and I. "You told me you were celebrating a birthday at your sister's, Koume."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Now don't you go worrying about it, you lumbering beast. Young Link here will take care of everything, no doubt." The elderly witch confided.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Let's hope anyway…" Tatl muttered, and flitted down to sip her tea.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Heh! Whatdya know, a bona fide hero. Good on ya mate!" Frank jokingly thumped my shoulder, causing me to sputter and cough on the bitter tea. "Oh oh, sorry 'bout that lil miss...uhh here be those cakes and bites I promised ya."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">After he set the two dishes full of thin white crackers and questionable patties of… something, I shoved a fistful of the first into my mouth and grunted in delight at the sweet delicate flavor compared to the strong and bitter tea. Tatl shook her head at my antics, but I was far too hungry to care.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ha! This sheila's sure got an appetite. How come you don't eat my food like she does, Koume?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Phah, if I ate your food in any fashion my heart would give out, you lummox!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I gulped down some more tea as the two exchanged various insults, still unsure about braving the contents of the other dish. Tatl tried to politely sip from the cup twice her size, but managed a quiet slurp at best. I offered a piece of cracker to her, and she shrugged then took a mouthful of the tasty morsel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As we finished the small, yet filling meal, I stood up to interject between the playful arguing of the two managers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That was nice and satisfying Frank." I nodded to the man who plodded over to take my empty cup.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Pleased as peaches to hear ya say that. I can give you another fill up if ya like?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh no, I'm fine now. We really do have to get a move on, the daylight won't last too much longer." I patted my stomach, surprised at how full I was with such a small meal. "But that was a really good lunch in any case, and thank you for your gracious hosting."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Think nothin' of it, just the basic Southie Swamp hospitality. Though I see ya didn't care much for the gator bites heh heh!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well, I don't really know what a 'gator' is to begin with…" I replied bluntly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"A gator? It's basically a giant water lizard." Tatl answered between mouthfuls of the cracker she kept.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"And it would just as soon as eat you as you did those cakes, heh heh. They're primarily up near the Deku Palace and those little shrubbies hunt them for sport. Since they can't eat the remains they ship the meat down to me. I sell it to passerby and adventurers, and I hear it's become a sort o' delicacy in Clock Town." Frank explained.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He wrapped up some of the uneaten gator biscuits in a handkerchief and handed the small parcel to me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Why don't you go on and keep this, maybe it'll keep you from starving out there or you can sell it off to one of the northies."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I hesitated for a second, but took the packet and stuffed it into my pouch. I thanked the kindly tour guide again and turned to the witch behind the counter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"OK, I guess we're ready for that boat ride now."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hmph… and I was just getting to a good part..." Koume muttered and dropped her reading material. "Come along then, the boat's right out back."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I waved to Tatl for her to follow and she sighed, dropping the remains of her meal. We said our goodbyes to the kindly boathouse manager and went after the old hag, who was hobbling out the front door.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Toodle-oo you two! G'luck on yer adventurin'" Frank bellowed out as we exited the home and walked around back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Koume's boat was quite a sight. Vibrant colors of red, green, blue, and yellow were painted along the sides in wide stripes and ridges. On the bow of the boat was fixed a very sharp-looking polearm that stuck out over the water. There was a small cabin up top and a strange contraption connected to the aft of the ship. We trotted up the laid out gangway that led to the deck, and Koume's gangly hands untied the rope keeping the boat near the dock.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"So, little hero…" Koume turned her bulging gaze to me. "I'm assuming you want to head straight to the Deku Palace. I feel I must warn you, outsiders are strictly forbidden."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That's where the monkeys told me to go, I don't have much of a choice if I'm to find Odalwa's lair." I shrugged at the witch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Why on green earth would you want to find that thing's lair? It would chew you up and spit you out in tiny pieces before you even got close!" Koume gawked, poking at me with a bony finger. "I know you're supposedly a hero, but….oh nevermind. I'm sure you have a way. It's not my job to question your abilities."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Can we get a move on? It's late and the sun is almost setting! Stop gabbing and start sailing!" Tatl remarked in exasperation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Quite the firefly, that one. Very well, you stand out here on the deck. Watch for monsters, I don't want any scratching up this lovely paint job, you hear?" Koume sighed and headed to the helm inside the cabin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I rolled my eyes at Tatl and drew my bow, ready for any threats. Swirls of light mist hung over the water and danced around the boat as it surged through the water. There was no other sound except for the strange contraption at the aft which quietly hummed, I assumed that it must have been the engine. Vines hung low from the branches high above, and gently parted as the bow of the boat moved down the river.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Why is it still so quiet, Link?" The fairy whispered into my pointed ears. "Surely *something *is alive out there?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'm betting the animals fled further south. They must have sensed the danger of the moon and Odalwa." I murmered, hoping that was the case. "Odalwa couldn't have killed everything…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The boat was quickly picking up speed, and we were cruising at a very good pace in no time. Koume kept a watchful eye on the waters, and Tatl relaxed a bit. I listened intently with my heightened senses, ready with my weapon drawn. Canyon walls rose around us, creating a claustrophobic effect but also a relative safety from attack from the shore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A deep gloom set in as we sailed further along the poison river, the air turning thick with a cloying, metallic scent that clung to the throat. Occasional bubbles broke the water's opaque surface with wet plopping sounds, and somewhere in the distance, a low, gurgling croak echoed from the trees, quickly swallowed by the silence. The oppressive atmosphere seemed to press in around us, making the boat feel smaller, more vulnerable with each passing second. Tiny, glowing red eyes peeped from a few bushes lining the bank, gazing at us in curiosity.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"We're getting near the palace, those are the deku." Koume called out from the helm, pointing at the bushes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Red and orange colored leaves and trees dominated the scenery, and the stench was almost too much for my nose to take. The river had become completely corrupted by the poison created by Odalwa. Thick, purple sludge clung to the sides of the boat, and dissolving remains of dead creatures and plants floated in the putrid muck.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Ahead a short distance away rose an immense wall of rock, with elaborate decorations and huge paintings covering the stone. A cavernous entrance lay at the bottom, with torches cutting through the gloom of the darkening swamp. The river suddenly veered away, and Koume stopped the engine and drifted toward the edge of the bank.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"This is as far as I can take you, I'm afraid. Any closer and the deku guards would sink the boat."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I guess this will have to do then, which is much better than I thought." I nodded to Koume. "Thank you, without your boat there would have been no way to get this far."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"And without you I'd still be a plant, fair trade. So go on now, get a move on. I'd rather not push these obstinate deku shrubs into attacking." Koume waved us off her boat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As soon as we were on land the witch started up the engine and sailed away. The dank, smelly air and torpid darkness that surrounded us almost made me regret coming here. But I gathered my courage and moved toward the torchlight of the entrance ahead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hoo hoot! Over here!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stopped in my tracks and Tatl drifted close to me. I looked around, trying to see ahead in the miresome gloom.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No no, over *here *you daft child!" The voice called again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I followed the source of all the noise through some shrubbery and into a wide clearing. Sitting in the center was a large statue of an owl with musical notes on the breast. An even bigger, strangely familiar owl was resting right beside it, staring at me with huge, wide eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Don't be alarmed, strange child." The giant bird spoke. "I've been watching you and your efforts ever since your arrival."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You… you've been watching me? Why?" I asked with a bit of uncertainty.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You stirred the winds of fate when you aided that witch, and removed the curse. Then when you transformed into that warrior, I knew that the guardians had sent you to save this world. And I have been called to help you." The owl recounted, gently bobbing its head. "This statue in my likeness represents an old way of travel. If you have an instrument, playing these special notes will call upon the power of my ancestors. The power will lift and transport you to this owl and others like it that you will find in the realm."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Huh… well that's handy!" Tatl twinkled, her voice laced with sarcasm. "And oddly convenient…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yes," the owl intoned, its golden eyes gleaming with solemn depth. "But night falls, and I must fly far to the south to hunt beneath the stars. I leave you with this: keep your courage, young one, and you shall surely succeed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The owl spread its vast wings, casting long shadows over the clearing. The guardian's flight was both majestic and lonely, leaving behind a silence that hummed with meaning. A rush of wind thundered outward as it lifted from the earth, feathers glinting like burnished bronze. I shielded my face, the air thick with the scent of damp feathers and stirred loam, heart pounding as the wings vanished into the darkened sky.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well.... I guess that answers my questions. I was wondering what all those owl statutes were for…" Tatl mused. "So… will you play your thingy so we can finally get out of this dump now? Let's go back in time again!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Just let me memorize these notes…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I studied the etchings along the statute. This was at least something I was very familiar with. Once I was confident they were committed to memory, I took out the Ocarina and nodded to Tatl, who moved closer to me. Raising the blue instrument to my lips, I closed my eyes and began playing the Song of Time and focused on going back to that first day.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The ocarina shone brightly as our surroundings faded into a pure white light, and we were quickly swept up in the currents of Time...</span>

      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">Realm of Shadows</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c21 c20">
      <span class="c28 c9 c16 c8">
        <br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The crazed man stepped through the spherical portal into a world of swirling blackness. A fierce wind, harsher than the wind from the last world, gushed forth in waves, almost as if in an attempt to blow the encroaching trespasser into oblivion. The sky above flickered with bleeding shadows, and the earth beneath him hissed at every step. Whispers tangled in the wind—remnants of the dead—pleading, cursing, warning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Yet still, the man walked unhindered toward a large dark building, the tempest merely whisking his clothing. His warded presence stained the ground, leaving faint smudges of seething magic in his wake. The intensive darkness moved closer as if it were a living thing, trying to suffocate him. It recoiled from him, and still, he walked forward.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Black tendrils of lightning burst forth from the shadowy ground, wrapping around the man like thorns. With a wave of his hand, he cast away the dark energy, and laughed as the lightning exploded into bursts of crimson flame. And still, he walked forward.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A giant, locked door loomed before him, a final obstacle. He came so far, this blockage would be little more than a slight inconvenience. He raised his hand, concentrating pure blue energy within his palm—and the door shattered into nothingness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The temple lit up with a faint, blue light when the man entered. Lingering purple mists softly drifted away with the outside air billowing in, revealing a large singular figure standing motionless in the center of the room. The man stopped in his tracks, recognizing it instantly: a Domigard. An ancient terror crafted solely to destroy intruders and protect sacred sites. Its armor bore sigils of a forgotten tongue.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">If the door’s destruction didn’t wake it, the man hoped it was defunct. But the air felt tight around him—as if the guardian, though inert, was aware.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He stepped forward, carefully. Each step brought him closer to the machine, each one a test. The crystalline light of the room painted a deceptive calm, but to lower his guard now would be foolish.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He passed it. The Domigard did not stir.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Before him stood a shallow staircase, leading to a pedestal veiled in solid, pitch-black shadow. He could see nothing upon it—only feel it calling to him, tugging something deep within his chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">There it was. Right before his eyes. His beloved mask.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He relaxed, momentarily distracted by awe. The pedestal hummed with presence. As he exhaled in relief, a gasp of breath echoed through the chamber.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The runes beneath his feet ignited.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The Domigard’s core awakened with a rising hum. Red light filled its eyes. The man dove as a blast of energy shattered the floor where he’d just stood.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He turned, his face grim. The Domigard was enormous—two meters taller than him. A boltspear in one hand. A gyroshield in the other. Its death glare burned into his bones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">It roared a metallic, jarring battlecry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The man’s laugh echoed back, sharp and feral. He trembled with malice, and fire erupted from his hands. The guardian burned, but not silently—it retaliated with a white-hot bolt that scorched the wall behind him, splashing molten rock across his back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He screamed. Leapt. Blocked the spear with a conjured sword. Knocked it aside. Was knocked in turn by the shield.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Rolling, dodging, ducking beneath the next swing, he moved with practiced desperation. His sword slashed against the armor—sparks flew but left no mark.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He remembered a weakness. He drove the blade into a joint. The guardian howled and dropped its shield.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He reached to lance his blade into the domiguard's vulnerability....but was too late. The boltspear pierced his leg.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The man fell, crying out in rage and agony. The Domigard laughed, a chilling, mechanical tittering. Its second strike came—he rolled, narrowly avoiding death. But the spear found his other leg, nailing him to the stone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Pain washed over him like drowning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">His breath stilled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He stared upward, barely able to think while his blood spread along the ground like ink. The Domigard circled confidently, knowing that it had won. It raised its foot and crushed his pinned leg, the bones shattering like glass.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Still, the man did not cry out again. He stared into the machine’s glaring eyes, defiant.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">His gaze drifted to the pedestal… so close. And then… something stirred within him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">A whispering voice: </span>
      <span class="c4 c12">We were never apart....</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The familiar whispers revived a small part of his memory....and he roared. He would not be defeated here, not now. Power suddenly surged through him. A shockwave of shadow exploded outward, slamming the Domigard into the wall with enough force to break open its chestplate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The man sat up. Bloodied. Furious....but alive.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He tore the spear from his shattered leg, dark blood gushing out. And smiling, he hurled it with perfect aim into the exposed chink.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The Domigard reeled, grasping at its chest in desperation and surprise.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A second later...it exploded into a burst of white-blue lightning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Shards of molten metal rained around him. He shielded himself with one shaking arm. Then, silence. He looked again at the voided pedestal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He would not die empty-handed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Inch by inch, he dragged himself across the floor. His hands left trails of red. His lungs rasped. But he climbed the stairs. Up to the blackness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">His fingers reached through the darkness....and then he felt it....fingertips trailing along the cold, hard surface.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Memories surged—visions of fire, screaming faces, a world torn asunder by the mask’s power. His own clan, eyes filled with sorrow, killing him to save their people, sealing away the mask forever in this realm of shadows.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The mask pulsed a dark wave of energy against his touch, eager...yearning....</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">His hand closed around it: the heart-shape, the spikes, the eyes. So familiar....</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He pulled it free and fell to the ground, splaying out, hugging the mask to his body and cradling it in his arms, as the last of his strength bled out of him. With a gasping whisper, he rasped out....</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I. Am. Whole."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">The darkness in the mask began to radiate out, surrounding the man's body in shadowy tendrils...and the man heard a final, familiar whisper from the depths of his mind: </span>
      <span class="c4 c12">And now, we begin again.</span>

        <br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The world faded back into view as Tatl and I exited the timestream, back to the first day. A strange heaviness clung to my chest, the air colder than I remembered, as if time itself had stripped me of something.... But I lost the thought as quickly as it came as my soft boots landed gently upon the hard pavement of the tower plaza. I lowered the dimming ocarina as Tatl regained her bearings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I don't think I'll ever get used to that…" Tatl huffed and swayed midair. "How you manage to stay calm through it all is beyond me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Trust me, you'll get used to it." I replied, checking around to see if anything had changed in the Tower Plaza.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No, I really don't think I will. I just hope that song you just learned isn't as bad…. speaking of which, do you want to try it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmm...I don't see why not…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">My gaze drifted to the construction crew hard at work in the center. Something about them caught my eye—an odd shift in their motion, or maybe the rhythm of their work. I couldn't place it, but it felt... off. Like returning to a scene I’d seen before, only now tinted slightly different. Tatl flitted into my line of sight, waving her luminous hands to get my attention.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hellooo what are you staring at? Let's get going!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Umm… right. Sorry...I don't know what came over me..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I sheepishly looked away and raised the ocarina once more. Remembering the notes written on the stone owl, I performed the tune and waited for something to happen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Was… Was that it?" Tatl asked, shifting her head around. "I thought we were supposed to fl- WHOAAAA!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">She was cut off as we suddenly launched into the air, carried upward by a pair of large phantom wings. White feathers surrounded and engulfed us, and we both yelped in surprise. Our world rocked and kicked, but it was over in mere seconds.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We landed gently back in the swamp clearing beside the owl statue. As the phantom wings and feathers dissolved into nothing, I stumbled to the ground, the world spinning violently around me. Grass itched against my cheek while a rush of dizziness surged up from my stomach, hot and overwhelming. I pressed a hand to the earth, grounding myself as the echoes of flight slowly faded from my limbs and balance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Good gods...I was not expecting that at all!" I cursed, clasping my fingers to my head. "Are you ok Tatl?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Urgh… y-yeah?" The fairy moaned, falling to the ground beside me. "No...no, gurgh... not... really."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I slowly got to my feet, but the blood rushing to my head caused me to stumble and I latched onto the statue to keep myself upright.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Whew… at least we made it back quickly in one piece. And the area doesn't smell as bad right now, so that's nice, right?" I tried to keep positive, looking around the clearing. "And there doesn't seem to be as much decay."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ughh… Maybe Odalwa hasn't made it here yet. Can...can you help me up?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I floundered over to the fallen fairy and scooped her into my fingerless gloves. She mumbled her thanks, and after my vision stopped spinning I took a deep breath and walked toward the river.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You, hooman! Hoalt!" A squeaky voice challenged in imperfect Hylian nearby.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I stopped, trying to spot where it came from.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"State yoor business for trespasseeng on Deku Territory!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A dozen deku suddenly popped out of the trees with a cacophony of rustling leaves and creaking armor, their sharp wooden lances gleaming beneath the canopy light. The sound of their leafy plating scraping and crackling as they moved made my heart skip a beat, each step they took adding to the tension pressing against my ribs. More than a few of them looked sickly and about ready to fall over.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhm, I'm here to defeat the monster. Have you seen it around?" I cautiously answered, and raised my hands to show I was unarmed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Moonster? There ees no moonster in the mighty Deku Territory. Ees poor excoose." One of the guards replied. "However, you doo noot seem very threatening, so you're weelcome to gaze in awe at our kingdom. But no going near palace! Understood?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yes, understood. Thank you." I curtly stated.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The deku guard nodded, let out a curt, squeaky affirmation, and with a flurry of rustling leaves, the squad disappeared into the trees above. I exhaled slowly, tension still coiled in my shoulders, aware of how close that encounter had come to turning violent. Their pride was palpable—and dangerous. I groaned inwardly at seeing the extreme arrogance of these deku, and I started walking toward the toxic river bank. Unfortunately, the palace was where we needed to go, so I had to find some way inside those walls.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl promptly flew out of my hands upon reaching the water, her balance had apparently recovered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What a bunch of morons… I never liked deku shrubs." The pixie grumbled. "Now...How do we get into to that palace?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well, we could sneak in by scaling those cliffs…but they look too steep without a really long rope... " I pursed my lips in thought. "Or I could try out this deku mask to see if it does anything useful. I don't really like either option… But I can't think of anything else."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah, I guess you don't really have a choice. I doubt you'd be able to climb such a steep cliff, so I say try the mask."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I paused, unwilling to go through any more transformations, but I eventually took hold of the plant-like mask, took a deep breath, and put the cool wood against my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I was mildly relieved when nothing seemed to happen, and I released a small puff of air through my mouth. The mask's surface felt rough and grainy beneath my fingers, a little warmer than I expected—as if it held the sunlight I’d just felt on my skin. A faint tingling pricked across my cheeks, and I swore I caught the scent of crushed leaves and damp earth rising from the wood. Although I did begin to feel a bit more invigorated, and the warm rays of morning sunlight that managed to somewhat pierce the gloom seemed to absorb into my body. A few moments later I heard Tatl chime in.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Well, it was worth a shot. Too bad though, you turning into a deku would have made this </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">so</span>
      <span class="c2"> much easier!" Tatl remarked, observing my lack of any apparent change. "We should start looking for another way, don't you think? Hey, aren't you listening? Link!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I blinked back to awareness, the echo of the mask's presence still humming faintly in my fingertips, and lowered it just as the impatient fairy yanked hard on my ponytail.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ow!" I winced. "Why do you always do that?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">She hovered with arms crossed, eyes narrowed. "Because you were off in la-la land again. You know I hate being ignored. And you looked like you were in a trance or something... Maybe you should leave that thing here."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I wasn't in a trance," I protested, trying to shake the lingering warmth that still pulsed in my skin. "I was just… feeling the sun. It was like it got pulled into me, like I’m a plant or something. I feel great."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Her glare softened a little. "You do? Weird. You </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">look</span>
      <span class="c2"> more refreshed. Maybe that mask has healing magic or something. Not that you were damaged much."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">I glanced at the deku mask again, unease still prickling beneath my skin. Whatever it had done, it had changed </span>
      <span class="c12 c26 c6 c8">something.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I have no idea… but...it seems all these masks just have a mind of their own. Still, healing would definitely be a nicer touch than a painful transformation." I shrugged, then secured the mask to my belt. "If it does provide healing...then it will definitely come in handy! Maybe it'll be better than drinking a health potion."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Alright, great...but healing powers won't get us inside the palace, I hope you have another plan…" Tatl pressed, hovering above my shoulder</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ok ok I'm thinking, look around and see if you can find any possible entrances or secrets. There could be deku in every tree, so try to be... subtle."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I started walking along the bank of the river, trying to look innocuous while Tatl searched around the wall. My shoulders tensed beneath my cloak, aware of the prickling sensation that crept down my spine—as if something unseen was watching us from the trees.. The brightly colored orange and red foliage of the area was a little harsh on the eyes. The smell of death, while not as horrible as before, was still pretty intense. To distract myself before I got a headache, I kicked a tiny pebble into the purple opaque water and ripples expanded across the surface.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Anything yet, Tatl?" I muttered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Nothing yet, there might be something a bit further from the entrance."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I casually walked further down the shoreline, keeping myself between the wall and river. The slow moving water flowed around islands in the middle, where wilting trees and flowers seemed to beg for deliverance. Swarms of bugs darted every which way between the gloomy mist and vines over the river. I swatted away a swarm that came too close, hoping that my small companion would spot something soon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhhh, are you ok Link?" Tatl inquired. "You're walking a little funny there."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmm?" I turned to the tiny pixie. "No I'm not, I'm just walking."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"You're just… I dunno, swaying your hips and kind of… sashaying around. Like, more than usual. It’s weird—I mean, are you even noticing it? You weren’t doing that yesterday, and now it’s like you’re walking differently, like someone might if they were trying to show off or… I don’t know. It’s not bad, it’s just… not </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">you</span>
      <span class="c2">. Are you feeling okay?" She gave me an odd look. "Did that deku mask fry your brain or something?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Pfft, no! I feel fine, Tatl. Stop watching me and watch the wall instead…" I snapped, though a ripple of unease crept through my chest. I hadn’t even noticed the way I was moving. As I turned from her, I tried to focus each step, willing my hips to stay steady. Was it the mask? The time magic? Or something deeper changing in me—something I couldn’t control? I shook the thought away, jaw clenched tight. Not now. I had to stay focused.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Right...oooook then, whatever you say." Tatl mumbled and glided to my side.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I heard an amused huff escape her cantankerous form, but chose to disregard it and returned my attention back to the river.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">There were very little signs of living fauna near the water, although birds and insects were chirping all around us. I saw a few small deku scrubs shuffling around across the river, and maybe a monkey or two in the trees. One thing that did catch my interest was a cave covered in spiderwebs near the deku on the opposite bank. An unlit torch sat beside it, and it looked as if it hadn't been lit or touched for years. I would just have to check it out in the future though, as Tatl had apparently located a possible entrance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey wait, I think I see something just up ahead." Tatl quietly spoke into my ear. "It's kinda covered by bushes, but if you walk a bit further you'll see it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Sure enough, there was a small opening hiding behind a bright orange bush. I looked around to see if any beady red eyes were watching us. Unfortunately there were a few peeping out from behind a rock nearby, seemingly ready to spring out and attack should we make a wrong move. Seeing how we were outnumbered ten to one here, I deemed it unwise to do anything violent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What's the holdup? Get in there, Link." Tatl urged.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"There's a bunch of deku watching us, I can't just stroll on in right now. We should look for something better…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A clamor of squeaking and clicking resounded from the other side of the river before we could start looking again. I peered over the purple mire to see a monkey start swinging towards the gate across on the overhanging vines. The deku tried to shoot it down, spitting rocks from their knotted mouths as the furry creature headed straight for the gate. I noticed that all eyes were focused on the monkey, and I decided to take the opportunity to move.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I pushed aside the spiny leaves of the bush and squeezed through the small opening, ducking down to avoid cracking my skull. The small tunnel was very narrow, and I could just barely crawl through it. Thankfully, the wall was not very thick and I reached the other side quickly, pausing before I crawled out.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Can you go check to see if anything is watching this way?" I whispered to Tatl. "You're small enough to go unnoticed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah, let me look real quick."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The fairy flew out and up, and was back in moments.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ok I think we're clear if we hurry. I think all the focus is on that monkey intruder." Tatl stated.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I nodded and peeked out of the opening, which sat on a ledge hanging over a large moat of poisoned swamp water. The moat flowed around a huge tree with high wooden walls of bamboo surrounding it. Large paintings, much like those on the outer wall, covered the wood with warrior deku figures and colorful plants. Huge branches extending from the tree palace, hanging high overhead. Large lanterns filled with what looked like fireflies swung from vines and ropes looped around the branches, providing an eerie green glow to the entire area. A bridge of gathered tree trunks led from the outer gate, across the toxic moat, up to a very well guarded inner gate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ok, so there's still no way I'm swimming through that water. That gate would be impossible to pass directly anyway… now what?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I sat back in the hole to keep a low profile as we figured out our next move.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What if we climbed those vines to the top of the wall? Those branches up there look close enough to grab onto and walk across?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh, I hadn't thought about that. Good thinking!" I grinned, and peeked around the corner once more.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The deku guards were still focused on the outside, and I could hear more cacophonous squeaking and monkey calls. It had apparently turned into a full on brawl between plant and beast, which served our purposes just fine for the moment. I nodded to Tatl, took hold of one of the thick lengths of vine, and began to shimmy up the wall.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The climb was hardly difficult, and I was sure had I set a new record for myself at how fast I went. A few minutes later and I was at the top ledge, with Tatl rising up behind me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ok, do you think you can make that leap to the branch?" A pale, tiny finger gestured to the branch a few feet away. "Or should we find another way? I don't want you falling to your death after we've come so far."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No, I'm pretty sure I can make it. This is our only shot anyway, so why not take it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I judged the distance, focusing all my energy on the jump, and sprung off the stone wall. I caught the branch midair, the rough bark dug into my hands and I winced as I pulled myself up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I brushed dust and particles of bark off my marginally cut fingers, while Tatl praised my prowess.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Haha, you get better at jumping every day! Are you sure you're not becoming a grasshopper?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You know, at this point nothing would surprise me. But I hope not, I'd rather not become a bug." I chuckled at the thought. "The monkeys from before said that their prince was being held here, but where? This place isn't as small as I'd hoped."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I wonder if they have any dungeons, oh wait…. probably not. I've never heard of deku taking prisoners. And yet, it's odd that they kept this monkey prince alive…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmm. If that's the case he must be important to them." An idea suddenly popped into my head. "The throne room!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I dashed along the tree limb with superb balance, looking down at the palace grounds far below. Deku shrubs of all colors and sizes shuffled to and fro, and the guards were celebrating a victorious defense.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh oh, look! There's the monkey prisoner, see?" Tatl twinkled for my attention. "He's being carried into the palace!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Sure enough a squirming, pure white monkey wearing a crown of twisted leaves that had been gagged, hogtied and was being hoisted by a group of angry-looking shrubs. They disappeared into the tree, and musical pipes emanated faintly from within. A promenade of deku followed after the monkey, and the grounds were soon empty save a few guard patrols.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wow, that's lucky… Now's our chance to find a way in, Link!" Tatl said, flying down the giant trunk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Umm great! But how do I get down?" I hissed after her. "I don't see any windows up here!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6 c8">I guess I'll have to find my own way down… Great</span>
      <span class="c2">. I grumbled inwardly to myself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I walked further along the branch and leaned against the rock-hard tree trunk. The trunk was smooth, like polished steel, no footholds to clamber down to. I was also standing on the lowest branch, so jumping down was out of the question since I was still several meters high.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I was so distracted in looking for a way down that I didn't notice Tatl had returned carrying vines. I nearly fell off the branch when the precocious sprite dropped them on me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oof!" I exclaimed, rubbing my head. "You know, you could have said something before throwing these at me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What? They were heavy." Tatl shrugged. "But there's your way down."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ugh… thanks. Can you help me tie these off?" I found and held up the ends, gesturing for her to loop them around the branch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh fine. I guess I have to do everything now…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">She took the vines and circled the branch, mock complaining under her breath as she gave me the ends to knot. I shook my head and did my best to create a solid anchor point, before leaning over the edge.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ok, here we go…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tugging on the vine and relieved the knot was secure and tight, I rappelled down the rough vine as quietly as possible. The deku were still distracted, so lowering myself behind the wooden walls was fairly easy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl rushed under my cloak after I hit the soft ground, hiding her shining body to be less conspicuous. I quietly crept along, heading towards the large corridor into the tree ahead. Seeing that the way was clear, I rushed inside.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The interior of the tree seemed to be devoid of any deku, and more of those firefly lanterns hung below the ceiling in chandeliers made of antlers. Loose, finely tilled soil made up the floor, soft and slightly damp beneath my boots, filling my nostrils with the smell of blooming earth and mud, which admittedly was a nice change from the stench outside. There were hallways and rooms all throughout the interior, each gently curving off from the main path. I hoped that the throne room was at the end of this hall, where the pipe music seemed to originate. My hopes were confirmed when I approached the rounded corner at the end of the corridor, hearing what sounded like a hundred voices cry out.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A booming deep voice rang out above the others, silencing the crowd and pipes as I sidled up to the corner.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"We shall punish this foolish monkey scum for his egregious crimes! He shall be made an example, to all the filth who would defy the might of the Deku Kingdom! We are the lords of this earth. NO ONE ELSE!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Angry, dissonant chords from the pipes followed, and deafening cheers roared out that shook the walls. These Deku were </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">completely</span>
      <span class="c6"> unhinged. My heart pounded in my chest, and I caught the gleam of frenzied eyes flashing in the torchlight. The king’s scepter struck the floor with a harsh </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">crack</span>
      <span class="c2"> that echoed through the chamber.—I couldn’t afford to get caught by this mob. Whatever punishment that these mad deku had in mind for the poor monkey, I wanted to avoid. I very carefully popped my head around the corridor to see an immense chamber filled to the brim with rustling deku. An ornate throne covered with golden leaves, fruits, and carved wood sat on a platform. A very large, gruff-looking deku holding a golden scepter was the speaker, whom I assumed to be the king.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The boisterous deku lord thrusted his scepter towards the bound monkey in the center of the room, still being held tightly by the guards.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Before we dole out this ignorant, disrespectful creature's punishment, I shall give him only one chance to tell us what he did with my daughter!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A guard nodded, removed the gag, and the monkey immediately shouted out above the din of the chamber.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I didn't kidnap her! We were investigating the ancient temple in Woodfall. We found a giant monster and it took her! If we don't work together on this, she and the entire swamp will die!" The monkey prince squawked. "Haven't you not seen the poison spreading from the creature?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"HA! There are no monsters like that in the swamp! You lie, foolish ape! You will pay most dearly for kidnapping our beloved princess!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The guards began to beat the monkey and carried him off down a hall at the other side of the chamber. The loud, angry cheers and squeaks of the mob forced me to step back and retreat down the main corridor with ringing ears.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link did you hear that?" Tatl belted in shock over the clamor in the throne room, right into my still-ringing ears. "The monster is in a place called Woodfall!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Argh! There was no possible way I </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">couldn't</span>
      <span class="c2"> have heard it!" I hissed, glaring at the irksome fairy, and clapped my hands over my ears. "Thank you, though, for making it even more clear to me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Sorry… I'm just saying, that's where we need to go."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well, do you just oh so happen to know where it is?" I asked sarcastically.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Um...no. I don't. Maybe we should-"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Stay and get more information, I know..." I grumpily interrupted Tatl. "We should probably get somewhere out of sight though, it sounds like they're finishing up."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I slunk away back down the hall, keeping to the shadows, when I heard the shuffling of shrubs closing in. I frantically searched for a place to hide, squeezing myself into a small gap while Tatl zoomed up to one of the lanterns to disguise herself. The noises approached, then receded, heading to the throne room with me going unnoticed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I waited, as motionless as I could be in the cramped space for a few more minutes to make sure no one else was coming. Not hearing any other leafy shuffles, I popped out of the crevice, a sharp ache shooting through my chest as my breast slammed against the wall—an all-too-frequent reminder of how much my body had changed with the action. I cursed under my breath as quietly as I could while massaging the sore flesh, nearly tripping over a small, white deku clothed in a robe of bejeweled leaves.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What? A human? Why are-"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The deku began to say, but I sprinted towards the exit before it could continue and sound the alarm. Tatl quickly scurried after me in a blaze of color, and the deku pleaded for me to stop.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wait! Not that way, the guards will catch you for sure!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I halted, hearing squeaking chatter up ahead. The white shrub was right, and I was fresh out of ideas.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I know a way out, a secret way. Hurry, please follow me!" The deku called and quickly darted back toward the throne room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I squinted suspiciously after the strange shrub, my instincts bristling with unease—but there was no time to weigh the risk. The urgency of the moment overruled doubt. The guards at the exit had heard the commotion and were quickly coming to investigate. Seeing that there wasn't much of a choice, Tatl and I scuttled after the mysterious deku.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">It stopped against a wall, hopping around anxiously for us to speed up. The deku turned to face the hard wood, knocked against a little bump, and to my surprise the floor right beside the deku opened up. We jumped in the hole after it, mere seconds away from being spotted by deku coming from all sides. The opening closed with a hushed *thump *and the lustrous white deku finally turned to us, a bit more relaxed now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Don't worry, I wish you no harm, human. But why are you here? Don't you know it's very dangerous?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link, I don't trust her. Don't say anything," Tatl muttered, voice low and urgent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Her? I blinked, trying to catch anything feminine in the deku's robe or voice. Who could tell? Still, the fairy's nudge jabbed at my ribs, and I waved her away in irritation, ignoring her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"We're here to save the swamp," I said cautiously. "This palace was the only lead I had on finding Odalwa's lair."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"So…. there really </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">is</span>
      <span class="c2"> a monster fouling the swamp….ohhh that poor monkey." The deku squeaked glumly. "Human, er, Link was it? If what you say is true, then our captive also speaks truth and the princess has been taken by the monster. If that is the case, we have committed an awful injustice against the monkey tribe, and war will surely happen unless something can be done. "</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl sighed in resignation, then recounted our encounter with Odalwa.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"We've seen the monster ourselves, up close. It was trying to capture us as well."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You've seen it, and escaped? Then you both must be formidable indeed! In fact, seeing as you made it this far into the palace, I believe you are the only ones who can rescue my daughter. And keep us from a calamitous war with the monkey tribe."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wait, daughter? If the princess was the one kidnapped…. then you must be the queen?" Tatl seemed confused. "Why aren't you stopping your guys from torturing that monkey and preventing war? Wouldn't they all listen to you?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I may be the matriarch, but my tribe has had their hearts filled with hate and anger, blaming all other species for our troubles. I've tried reasoning with the king, but he is perhaps more stubborn than the mountains themselves."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Maybe…." I cut in with a theory spinning in my head. "...the monster is inadvertently causing all of this? With it spreading the poison in the swamp, it's destroying the water supply. Deku are a plant species, and all the plants we've seen so far are dying or corrupted. How come you seem normal?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Royalty, by tradition, feeds from the canyon springs… So your theory is sound."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What about the king, then? He seems just as mad as all the others!" Tatl performed a mocking gesture.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I frowned at the fairy, cupping a hand over her to allow the deku queen to continue.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"As I stated, my husband is very stubborn. He has been infuriated by the state of our people, and with our beloved princess gone missing, he has been pushed beyond the edge of insanity." The queen mourned.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I overheard the monkey prince mention a place called Woodfall… Where is that?" I gently asked the sorrowful deku.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"It is the Swamp's most sacred of places. The very heart of life for all things living here and the main source of water for the swamp… It's not too far south, but it may be difficult for you to travel there. It's become a dangerous land."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So what do you suggest we do?" I inquired, still hiding Tatl behind my gloved palm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"There's an heirloom of great importance to our tribe here, one that signifies the greatest victory of our kingdom." She explained, shuffling down the dim secret passage. "Our first warrior king defeated a powerful Dinolfos warlord in this very tree, and hung his hide as a trophy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">The queen pressed a switch on the wall, and with a low </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">click</span>
      <span class="c2">, a hidden door creaked open to reveal a narrow stairwell spiraling upward. The musty scent of age-old wood drifted out, mingling with the cooler air rising from below, as faint echoes hinted at the upper chambers beyond.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"The hides are special in that they can take on the same colors as the environment they are placed in. The princess unfortunately took one of them to sneak away unseen… I'm praying that you can do the same."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We followed her up the stairs, into an empty room, and through another hidden corridor into what appeared to be a treasure room. Jewels, ornate weapons, books, and fancy furniture lined the walls, or gathered in neat little piles. At the end of the room sat an altar with unlit candles set upon it, and above it was hanging a reptilian hide that looked as if it had a brilliant scenery of crystal blue waters and large trees painted upon it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Here is where we protect our valuable heritage." The queen solemnly spoke up. "I'm entrusting you with this very precious treasure because I have no other choice to save my daughter. When you bring her back safely, you will also return this."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">She stepped up to the altar, taking a pole to reach and lower the hide, which shifted colors to match the wall behind it as it moved. I was taken aback at how ghostly transparent it seemed, save for a golden, decorative border that appeared to float in the air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I do hope you are able to use this to its full potential." The deku queen handed the hide to me. "It's much more gaudy than the piece the princess took, so you will need to keep that in mind. If anything should come close enough, you would be easily spotted."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I took the scaly leather from her outstretched arms, feeling its surprising weight and cool, slick texture against my gloves as I tried to decide how I was going to wear it. Tatl lightly touched the scales, gazing in awe at seeing how well it blended in with its surroundings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh, that won't do… There's no way you'd be able to use it properly without some modifications. Please, wait here while I correct this little problem. And I ask that you please don't touch anything… I dearly hope that I can trust you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The white queen took the hide once more, and rushed out into the other room. I heard the door gently close and we were alone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wow… she must be pretty desperate to leave us alone in the treasure room. I guess they really need help." Tatl remarked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Don't even </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">think</span>
      <span class="c2"> about taking anything." I chided crossly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey hey, I wasn't going to. Calm down, Miss Worrywart."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I frowned at the impudent fairy, who immediately apologized and fluttered onto my shoulder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So we wait then. Fine."</span>

    </h1>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl and I waited for a few hours within the treasure room of the Deku Palace. I was beginning to worry that this was all a trick, and we were now prisoners just like the monkey prince. Yet I remained calm, mainly for Tatl's sake, and decided to sit and relax in one of the decorative chairs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ughhhhh it's been hours!" my fairy companion moaned. "Where is she? Doesn't she know we're on a strict time schedule?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Not likely. I'm sure she'll be back soon, just be patient." I sighed at Tatl's impatience.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I twiddled my thumbs and sat back in the chair. Maybe I could take a nap here? I closed my eyes, as the lack of any action was making my body drowsy. It was too bad there weren't any masks that could keep you awake forever—maybe when we got outside, the Deku Mask would help revive me a bit. It seemed to give me a momentary boost of energy, so there was that option at least.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Are you enjoying your mental tea party over there, princess?" Tatl scoffed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What?" I opened my eyes to look at her. "Are you just that bored that you have to mock me?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No, you just look so fancy sitting with your legs crossed and hands together, hehe. You've been doing stuff like that all day—tilting your head, touching your hair, even that cute little pout when you're annoyed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I glanced down and quickly uncrossed my legs, sitting as normal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"It's like... you're still you, but parts of you are acting totally different. Like the body's got its own instincts now. You sure nothing's getting into your head?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'm fine. I don't feel any different. This dumb body must have a mind of its own," I grumbled, but even as I said it, a flicker of doubt passed through me. "Ugh. It's technically been a full week living like this. I'd say the gods must be angry with me, because this is ridiculous."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Why would they be angry with a hero? I think you just stumbled into the wrong place at the wrong time. But don't worry," Tatl reassured, patting my head. "We're almost done with the swamp. That leaves only three areas next, right? We'll get you turned back in no time. You've just been having an off day, is all."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I suppose you're right… but please, no more jokes. It's hard enough as it is, OK?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ooof… that's a tough bargain. I'll try, but uh, you know me, hehe!" The fairy giggled, tussling my scarlet bangs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I rolled my eyes and smiled, waving her away in mock frustration, but I was still grateful for her company. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl landed on my shoulder once more and we waited in the awkward silence, but only a few minutes passed by when I heard the secret passage open in the next room. The Deku Queen must have finally returned. I stood up from the chair and waited for her to enter. To my surprise, a small Deku wearing simple blue leaves entered. Worried that this one would sound the alarm, I prepared to pounce and restrain the tiny stranger.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Thankfully, the queen shuffled into the room before I could make a move, carrying with her the folded hide. She spoke soon after the secret passage closed shut.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'm sorry that took so long," she apologized, noticing the uncertain expression on my face. "Oh, don't worry about this one, she is my most trusted handmaiden. She managed to craft it into a somewhat wearable human cloak. I do hope it's large enough to suit your purposes. We really don't get to see many humans, so forgive her if the measurements aren't exact."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I reached out to take the heavy cloak. The material was still bizarre to me as the colors constantly shifted as it moved. It was rather hefty, being made of scaly leather and all. Wearing this would definitely slow me down, but the added stealth was worth the trouble. I unslung my bow, and the blue maid helped to strip off my green cloak, folding it upon a chair.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh, those are interesting masks there… Did you make those yourself?" the queen inquired, discovering the masks on my belt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ummm, yeah. For the, uh, mask festival in Clock Town," I nervously replied, not wanting her to know the truth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"They look very well-made. You did a wonderful job, especially on the Deku Mask. So realistic… You must be a big fan of our tribe to get the details so accurate." She laughed, then apologized. "I'm sorry you have seen us at such a dire hour…you must be so disappointed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No, um, I'm still impressed at what you have here. And no one is perfect, so… yeah." I stammered, unsure of what to say.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I draped the scaly cloak around my shoulders and clasped it around the magic pendant, hiding the masks in the process. Aside from the added weight, it was almost comfortable. The cloak had a loose hood hanging along the back, and the length was just a little shorter than my other cloak. Its surface shimmered faintly, like rippling water over bark, reacting subtly to the torchlight.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wow...that's awesome!" Tatl exclaimed. "You'd be nearly invisible if that shiny golden border wasn't there!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I rotated my shoulders to adjust the weight and uneven hemming. "Yeah… but what am I going to do about my bow? Carrying it on my back won't do me any good with this on."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl fluttered down beside me, eyeing the shimmering fabric. "Maybe you could sling it beneath the cloak, across your chest? It'll be awkward, but at least you won't give yourself away."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I considered it, then carefully threaded the bow beneath the folds of the cloak, tucking it against my side and looping the strap across my torso. It wasn't perfect, but it felt secure enough and mostly concealed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"It's... a bit of an awkward fit, I'm sorry. As I said, we're not used to accommodating humans, but it will help you remain undetected by the guards," the white queen stated.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">She uttered a series of clicks and squeaks, and the little Deku maid exited into the next room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Now to business. Woodfall is located in an old crater further south. Follow the river upstream and it'll lead you right to the temple. Although it is a sacred place to us Deku, we avoid it now to avoid it due to the sheer number of deadly creatures that have moved in around the area. That cloak will help, but you will still need to be careful. Some reports even say that a few Dinolfos have been spotted there as well."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I don't think I've ever seen a Dinolfos. Are they anything like Lizalfos?" Tatl wondered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"If I remember the legends correctly, Dinolfos were a large, fire-breathing tribe of lizards that ruled this swamp long ago," the queen explained. "They were brutal overlords who enslaved the Deku people for generations. It was only with the help of the forest fairies that our ancestors were able to rise up and overthrow them, claiming the swamp as our sacred home. The war was long and costly, but their defeat marked the beginning of the Deku Kingdom. If the Dinolfos have truly returned, then you must be on your keenest guard—for it could mean the return of an age of darkness."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'll be careful, I know just how perilous the world can be." I calmly replied. "What do you think the safest way out of the palace would be?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I honestly do not know, I'm afraid. I haven't been beyond the walls in years. But you must have gone around the main entrance somehow, so you should leave through the same entrance you came."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmm… that could be a big problem. There are probably guards at every entrance in the palace now because of those monkeys from earlier… We'll be caught before we even saw the main gate." Tatl glumly sat on my shoulder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I can distract them while you sneak away, don't fret about that. However, you're on your own outside the walls." The queen headed into the next room, beckoning us to follow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"That's more than I can ask, thank you." I humbly replied.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We followed the white deku and her maiden through a different route within hidden passages. The queen opened the hidden door, and I saw the wooden walls that bordered the tree palace.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wait here, we will go and distract the guards to allow you to get by. After they leave, please hurry to the south. I fear my daughter does not have much time!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The two shuffled up and out of the secret chamber, followed by frenzied squeaks and chitters. A mass of shuffling leaves retreated into the distance, and there was silence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhh… was that the distraction?" Tatl looked around in confusion. "Should we get going now? I'm... not sure."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I shrugged and pulled the weighty hood over my head. Tatl dipped under the cloak while I peeked out from the secret door. The coast was clear; the bridge across the moat was left unguarded. I quickly tiptoed to the bridge, hoping that the camouflage was working, and slowly glided onto the horizontal trunks over the purple waters. The wood creaked softly beneath my boots, a reminder of how precarious our stealth truly was.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Just ahead were two stationary deku, watching the outer gate. The creatures appeared faded, the coloring not as bright as other deku. Being so close to the toxin must have taken its toll on them. Still, I carefully crept behind them, peering to the ledge we came in on. A narrow plot of land led around the moat, so I could easily sneak to the tiny opening.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">At the hidden entrance, I paused to readjust the ill-fitting cloak. The bow underneath had been grinding into my spine with every step, the curved limb pressing uncomfortably through the fabric. Grunting softly, I slipped the strap free, angling the weapon across my chest instead. It nestled beneath the cloak awkwardly, the tension of the scaly fabric pulling tight against the bowstring and biting into my shoulder. Still, the shift offered some relief, and I exhaled through my nose before motioning forward. We proceeded through the hole.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">After I crept out the other side, I looked around to make sure that we remained undetected. Judging by the deepening gloom, I realized the sun was setting. Deku guards patrolled all around us, holding the firefly lanterns to cut through the darkness with that eerie green glow. Nocturnal animals filled the night air with a symphony of warbles, and the humid air clung to my skin like a second cloak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey, why are we stopped? I can't see, is everything alright?" Tatl muttered and poked me in the back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"The sun is setting and the deku are increasing their patrols. I doubt they would be as hospitable as they were earlier, especially if they caught us with this hide."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"If it's getting dark, wouldn't that just make it easier to sneak around them? Let's go already."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"If I can't see, I'm just going to be stumbling around in this heavy thing until we're either spotted or killed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well, what if we made camp somewhere? There's gotta be something around here that we can lay low in." The fairy grunted and shifted around. "I think that's the best plan, because this cloak is crushing me…urgh."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I can believe it." I sympathized with my partner. "But come to think of it, I do remember seeing something across the river. That structure with the spider webs…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Great, let's go then so I can get out of here!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I shushed the fairy and waited for one of the deku guards to pass, then quietly maneuvered back to where I saw the cave. When I looked across the slow-moving river, finding the cave was all too easy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A single torch was lit, almost as a warning it seemed, and the white spiderwebs protecting the entrance appeared to glow with the dancing flames. There was even a small wooden bridge nearby, with only a single guard standing watch. I heard a noise behind me and saw another guard hopping along, heading straight toward me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I moved onto the bridge quickly, silently shifted past the other sentry, and slipped past the spiderwebs into the cave.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The sticky webbing wrapped around the cloak and into the hood, clinging to my face. I recoiled and spat the fibers away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Pbbth, dumb spiderwebs…." I slapped the last of it off my hands. "OK Tatl, we're safe now. I hope."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The fairy was all too happy to pop out, but looked around uncertainly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhh… this place looks... infested. Are you sure you want to camp here?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"We don't have much of a choice, it's way too dark now to move and the soldiers would catch us if we camped out there."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"But… getting eaten by spiders sounds worse. Can't we just sleep in a tree or something?" Tatl nervously looked around.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No, this is fine. We will only stay for the night, then we'll leave at first light. I think any spiders in here would be more afraid of us than we are of them." I removed the cloak and bow and sat back against a web-free part of the wall.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhhh… you mean spiders like that?" Tatl pointed to the ceiling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Three massive skulltulas clung to the ceiling, appearing to be feeding on something entangled within their thick webs. It didn't look like they had noticed us yet, and I didn't hesitate to give them time to. I drew back my bow quickly and picked them off one by one. The last one tried to get away, but the magic bolt pierced its exoskeleton and it dropped to the floor to join the others with a resounding crunch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"There, happy now? Go to sleep." I sighed, pulling the cloak around me to act as a camouflaged blanket and closed my eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"But… but… OK, you're the boss."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The pixie landed on my shoulder and curled up against my neck. It wasn't long until we were both sound asleep.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I dreamt I was falling. Plummeting down some black abyss. Rocky walls around me rushed past, turning into vine-tangled trees. Waterfalls of purple ooze sprouted out of the wooden walls, filling the air with a stench too foul to describe. Rotten leaves fluttered around me, building up until I could no longer see. I tried in vain to clear them away, but soon I was buried in mounds of leaves.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Then I found myself on a hilltop overlooking a vast frozen wasteland. Dark, gray skies loomed overhead, casting the land in dreary misery. Ruins of stone monuments were strewn about, surrounding an enormous crater. Cold ash rained from the sky like snow, carried by the howling wind. I looked to the debris field, and I saw the tiny dot of a lone person rummaging through the clutter—a hunched figure draped in tattered robes, their movements sharp and desperate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A strange familiarity prickled at the back of my mind, as if I had seen that silhouette before, somewhere beyond dreams. There was something unnatural about the way the figure moved, as though it were both seeking and escaping. A faint twist towards me showed a grinning smile flashed on the figure's face, only for a moment. My chest tightened. I couldn't place it, but the man felt important. Dangerous. Ancient. A creeping sense of dread clawed at the edge of my awareness, as though this barren place was more than a dream...more than a memory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">My vision suddenly blurred, and I woke up. Dim light was coming through the cave entrance. Had I really slept all night? Tatl was lightly breathing as she snoozed comfortably on my shoulder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Tatl, wake up. It's time to get going." I gently nudged her with a finger.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Mmm… already?" Tatl yawned. "OK, ok… sheesh. You're such an early riser."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No time for sleep when the world needs saving. Besides, I want to get out of this disgusting swamp as soon as possible." I groaned as I pulled spider webs out of my hair.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl sighed as she lifted from my shoulder and I rose too, gathering the cloak and bow. The spider corpses were beginning to smell like old cheese, so I moved quickly. Tatl sluggishly slipped underneath the hood after I threw it on over the bow. Flipping up the hood and ready to get on our way, we left the web-infested enclosure, passing smoldering torches. There didn't seem to be any deku around, but I still chose to sneak about until I knew we were safe.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Heeding the deku queen's earlier directions, I followed the river upstream. The path was well defined, much easier to follow than any others we found. Better still was that the canopy wasn't as thick further down, and I could finally look beyond vines and leaves. The sky was overcast as usual, but I was grateful for the warm breeze of fresh air it provided. I couldn't see the moon, but I did see distant plumes of smoke rising up ahead, appearing to be coming from further along the pathway.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">It wasn't long until I reached the source of the smoke. Hearing gruff voices, I veered off the path for some reconnaissance from higher ground. A low hill jutted out nearby, thick with briars and wet with swamp mist. I pushed through the brush, every step sinking slightly into the muck, until I crested the rise and crouched to survey what lay below.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The camp sprawled out like a crude scar across the swamp floor. Fortifications of gnarled wood and thorny branches ringed its perimeter, lashed together haphazardly but effectively. Smoke from cookfires drifted through the air, clinging to the treetops in a murky veil. Against a craggy cliffside, wooden bunkers had been stacked like crates—utilitarian shelters devoid of comfort.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">But it was the prisoners that stole my breath. A dozen figures—humans, monkeys, even deku—were shackled beneath a twisted tree, their backs to its roots and their eyes hollow with exhaustion. Iron manacles cut into their limbs, and the ground around them was churned with filth. They were hemmed in by a fence of sharpened stakes that radiated menace.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A sick churn twisted in my gut. I didn’t know these people, but the sight of them—caged and humiliated—clawed at something raw inside me. I understood what it felt like to be powerless, to have no say in your fate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Scaly lizalfos patrolled the area, their movements slick and efficient. Their skin shimmered in varied hues—green, bronze, rust—each clutching crude weapons. Most bore dented shields and short blades, though a few were more heavily armored, spear-wielding and barked commands with sharp snarls. Leaders, likely. Rafts bobbed in the dark water beyond, fitted with crates and crude ballistae....I could only guess that they were preparations for a raid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Two guards hovered near the prisoners, jeering as they flung muck at their captives. One of the deku flinched and received a blow for it. I clenched my jaw. There was no honor in it—just cruelty. And if I did nothing, it would continue.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Tatl, look at this…" I quietly whispered. "What do you think of this?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">She peeked from under the scaly garment, then carefully hovered to a vantage point. Her eyes scanned the camp below—then widened.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmm… I'm thinking no." Her voice was tight, not dismissive. The fairy shook her head and zipped back under the cloak like a child hiding from thunder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey come on now, weren't you the one bugging me about that kid in Clock Town? What about those prisoners?" I blocked off Tatl's retreat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Oh please, that was just a measly gang of dumb humans. </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">This</span>
      <span class="c6"> is an army of lizalfos! Have you ever fought one of those?" she hissed, her voice cracking slightly. "Those things are fast, and brutal—and there's </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">dozens</span>
      <span class="c2"> of them. And look at their armor, their weapons… That’s not a skirmish, that’s a warband."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I've fought several. And that was when I was just a kid. These shouldn't be a problem… especially with a bow," I replied, though even I could hear the tension in my voice, buried beneath the confidence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I went back down the hill to remain hidden, then quickly removed the cloak to grab my bow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Are you nuts? There's at least thirty of those monsters down there! You can't pick all of them off! Your bow isn't exactly the most stealthy of weapons—it shoots </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">light,</span>
      <span class="c2"> for crying out loud!" Tatl quietly exclaimed, the panic edging back into her voice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well then… I'll just use the mask." I pointed to my masked soul, fingers lingering for a moment longer than usual. There was a flicker—almost imperceptible—of something tightening in my chest. Still, I shook it off and pulled the bulky camouflage over my shoulders. "Lizalfos are pretty predictable, and they rarely attack in groups."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Sheesh… you are headstrong." Tatl rubbed her head and sighed, her wings fluttering unevenly. "It's a wonder you're still alive, but I guess that's just what you hero types do."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Trust me, this will work, haha." I chuckled and pulled on the hood. "Besides, I can always use a lookout. Just be careful, alright?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The fairy nodded and followed me back up the hill. I crouched next to a tree, using it as a brace and took aim, carefully maneuvering the bow beneath the folds of the heavy cloak. The fabric dragged slightly as I adjusted, and I felt the tension in my arms from keeping both weapon and concealment steady.. I was careful to keep my lustrous blue bow behind cover, Tatl was right about it lacking subtlety, but I appreciated its power.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Take out the ones with the spears, they look tougher than the rest." Tatl whispered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Good idea…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I gently shifted the bow toward the armored lizard directing a crew of lesser ones carrying cargo to the river. The armor looked heavy, but due to the creatures physique, was also sparse. I aimed for the opening at its neck and fired off a bolt of energy. The lizalfos screeched and clawed at the smoking hole in its neck, as it fell dead in the churned mud, I moved on to another guard, dropping it in a similar fashion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">By this time the camp was confused and they all stood still, looking around frantically. I took advantage by killing three more of the lizalfos spearmen. After the third fell, the entire camp sprang up in arms and took cover, with me hiding behind the tree.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well, they know we're here now." Tatl bluntly stated. "What's the plan?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"We can move to another tree, but they'll probably come up here soon. I'll try to take a couple more out before it turns to hand to hand combat."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uh… sure. Good plan… I hope." The fairy nervously muttered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I beckoned Tatl to follow with my bow, and we ducked behind the hill and ran to another tree. The lizalfos were still scattered and peeking over their cover trying to locate us. I waited a few moments before unleashing another barrage, searching for the toughest targets. Two of the spearmen hiding on the river rafts, and were the closest to us. The last four were behind the barracks' walls and trying to get the others up the hill to find us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The easiest kills seemed to be the ones closest, if I took any longer to decide I'd lose my opportunity. The two on the rafts were quickly dispatched, but our cover was blown. The small horde gathered its collective wits and began to flank us so we wouldn't move.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"OK, this is it. Are you ready, Tatl?" I pulled off the hood and looked to a mildly frightened Tatl. "When I put the mask on, you fly to the canopy. I don't want you getting hurt again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"That's fine by me, I'll help watch your back though. I'm ready as I'll ever be."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I heard a group of the lizards drawing near, and nodded to Tatl as I reached for the mask. A tremor of adrenaline ran down my spine—not from fear, but from the strange anticipation that always came before transforming with the mask’s power. Each time it felt more familiar, more natural, and though I welcomed the return to my own form, there lingered a faint unease at how quickly the transformation came—how easily I could slip between selves without hesitation. The first lizalfos to peek around the tree, with maw full of teeth snarling in between tongue flicks, was in for a fatal surprise as my razor sharp sword met its exposed neck.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Green blood spayed downhill as the headless body rolled toward its kin. A battle cry sounded from one of the lizalfos when they saw me standing ready. Sure enough, one by one they charged. I dodged, blocked, and parried every attacker, slaying each in turn with ease. Tatl suddenly called out from above in warning, and I rolled aside as a spear buried itself where I had just stood. One of the armored leaders was rapidly dashing up the hill, leaping over its fallen comrades, and drew a serrated longsword from its back. The lizard was at least a foot taller than me, and slitted yellow eyes glared daggers at me as it hissed in anger.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I met the monster head on, knocking aside its jagged blade and swinging mine with a backhanded stroke. The lizalfos leapt back to attack again, and thrusted toward my stomach. I twisted around with my shield deflecting the blade, forcing the monster off-balance. Taking advantage the opportunity, I cleaved my sword down the lizalfos' back, nearly cutting it in two.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I walked down the hill, stepping over the bodies and into the encampment. The air was thick with the metallic stench of blood, mingling with the swamp’s natural rot. Each step squelched beneath me, the mud soaked with the remains of battle. My boots cracked against scattered bones and broken weapons, the aftermath of violence echoing with a grim finality. A strange calm settled over me, but beneath it buzzed a tension—residual adrenaline mixed with a creeping sense of what I’d just done, and what might still come. The remaining lizalfos warily circled around me, searching for any openings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Who's next, you pile of uglies!" I smirked, taking care to watch my back. "I haven't got all day."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">One decided to be gutsy and made a pass at me, but only ended up being gutted instead. The others shrieked and hissed in both anger and terror as green blood and organs spilled out onto the muddy ground.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeeeegh! You pay for kill, human slime!" One of the taller spearmen yelled in a shrill, raspy voice. "We go get big boss and you die!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A spear was flung at me, missing by a full meter, and the last dozen of the camp retreated to the south, shrieking as they went. Tatl drifted down to me, breathing a sigh of relief.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well, that was sure… disgusting. All that blood… Yech!" The fairy retched. "But I sure am glad you are a skilled fighter, I bet they are too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl pointed to the chained up prisoners near the river. They were cheering and praising my efforts. I raised my sword and let out a triumphant cry, the weight of the battle still buzzing in my veins. The prisoners' cheers met mine, their voices raw with relief and disbelief. For a brief moment, pride surged through me—tempered not by arrogance, but by the fierce resolve to protect. It had been a good battle, but the cost lingered in the blood-slicked ground beneath my feet. After I cleaned the blade on the sole of my boot, I sheathed my sword and splashed through the muddy puddles into their enclosure, freeing the prisoners with a sharp blow to their chains. A young woman covered in filthy rags embraced me, with tears running down her face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Thank the gods you freed us! The horrors those THINGS put us through… I can't thank you enough, sir! You are amazing!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Heheh, thanks...uhhhh… why did those monsters imprison you?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"T-they said we were…" She shuddered in fear. "We were to be sacrifices to their 'god'. A horrible, horrible monstrosity! I s-s-saw it… I actually *saw *it… I'll never forget… never. Never!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey hey, easy. You're safe now, where are you from? Can you get back there safely?" I asked the troubled girl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"We're all f-from Couth… at least us humans. It's small settlement near the ocean. I, uh..think it's west?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A middle-aged man hobbled over with a deep gash in his right arm and a dirty bandage on his left leg.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I know the way, swordsman. Don't you worry about us none. You just focus on wiping those bloody lizards off the map."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Are you sure? It looks like you can barely stand, let alone hike through miles of poisonous bogs." I attempted to brace the man as he stumbled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">He irately waved me away. "No I'll be right as rain in no time. I've been through worse, hell, we all have. We're a hearty people, us swamp folk!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The deku prisoners had already moved off, and the monkeys and humans were helping each other out. I smirked at the man and nodded my approval.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I can appreciate that. I've been through quite alot myself and I'm still kicking, haha!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Just going off how young you look, I'd never believe that. But the way you took out those scaly bastards with such ease…well. You've definitely got experience, kid." The man said, patting me on the back. "But we best hop to it, we can use those boats to make good time. I wish you luck, swordsman. Got a name? Mine's Smit."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link, and thank you." I shook Smit's outstretched hand. "Stay safe out there."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You too, lad. Those worms are cookin' something up, be on your toes, eh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Smit turned and walked back to the group with the young woman, who smiled faintly at me before rushing off to the boats. Ready to move on, Tatl and I turned southward and resumed our hike.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So, the lizard guy said something about a big boss. You think that might be one of those dinolfos?" Tatl finally spoke up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"If it is, then I'll take it out just like the others. A dinolfos can't be much worse than a lizalfos. Don't worry about it." I replied.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well, don't you think we should maybe not be so obvious right now? I really doubt they'll let you off so easily. And there's a lot of hiding places, they could be laying out an ambush just for you!" Tatl huffed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I hesitated. This time my mask had kept us safe, powerful—but walking openly in it was starting to feel more like a beacon than a shield. And deeper still was that unsettled twist in my chest, the discomfort I hadn’t quite named yet, like slipping further into something I couldn’t fully return from.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So, you're saying I should take off this mask?" I asked, more quiet now. "Why? They can't get close enough to me while I'm like this."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"All I'm saying is we should be careful… sheesh." Tatl murmured, but her voice had softened, just a bit. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I sighed, not arguing. "Fine, if it'll make you happy I'll take it off after we get out of sight." I grunted, then added more quietly, "Not that I’m in love with it either."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I looked around and the people I'd freed had apparently moved on, eager to escape their former prison. Figuring now was a good time to remove the mask, I stopped and got Tatl's attention.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Alright hold on. I'm taking it off…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The fairy nodded, halting with me, and I pulled the mask off. The transformation was becoming less and less painful every time, for which I was grateful—but the ease of it unnerved me slightly, as though the boundary between forms was thinning too quickly, blurring who I was and who I might become. Watching my hair grow and change color before my eyes, I blew the scarlet bangs from my face and resumed walking, turning to look at my companion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well, shall we?" I shrugged to Tatl, who remained still.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah, right behind you."</span>

      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">Woodfall</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl and I walked along the river's edge in silence. The rotten stink was quickly getting worse with each step, and I heard the churning of a waterfall up ahead. I pulled the hood over my nose in an attempt to stifle the odor, but it did little good.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The river eventually twisted to the right, around a dense cluster of trees and ferns. After we turned the corner, the careful walk soon turned into a tiresome climb up a large hill with steep, ancient stairs cut into the side of a small mountain. More of the dreary sky opened up as trees and vegetation grew more sparse as we climbed higher.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We passed by shattered statues and dilapidated pillars of limestone with deep cuts, jagged and discolored, as if some monstrous claws had gouged through the stone in a fit of rage. The scars were blackened around the edges, suggesting ancient fire or corruption had licked at them once, and the air here felt heavier—as though whatever made those marks might still be watching. like something raked massive claws along them. Waterfalls of deep violet spilled over the cliffs above us, and I caught the acrid scent of fires burning. We must've been getting close to the lizalfos base camp. I could hear raspy chatter and metal clanging ring out over the roar of the falling water.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"It's probably a good idea to hide again, Tatl." I quietly muttered, "Or you can go and get a peek at what's at the peak."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'm tired of being stuck suffocating under that thing, so I choose the other option. Stay here so I don't lose you, I can barely see you as it is."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Fine by me, just be careful."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I leaned against a broken stone pillar covered in dead vines, and Tatl rose up to take a cautionary look over the ridge. She soon returned with a disheartened expression fixed on her features.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So? What did you see?" I anxiously inquired.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhh.. You aren't going to like it. There's at least one hundred of those lizards up there, camping on platforms over a lake." The fairy replied, "And…something else that I couldn't fully see, but it was pretty big."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well, an army of lizalfos is a challenge, but I bet I can defeat them or scare them off like before." I scratched my chin in thought. "I wonder if that big thing is the 'boss' they mentioned."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You think it could be what the deku queen was talking about? That dino-whatever?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Only one way to find out for sure. This could be that temple where Odalwa's lurking." I started walking up the stone steps, making sure the cloak was properly draped. "I think I've got a plan forming already…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"But, I didn't see any buildings except for a few huts and maybe a cave where the big guy was?" Tatl squinted to see where I was heading, quickly following. "Are you sure this is the place?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yep, so let's get this over with. You can watch my back again, OK?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey, someone has to keep you alive right? Haha!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Heehee…. the hero's hero…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We both giggled, but quickly grew silent when we neared the top. Levity aside, this would be a dangerous task, and we would need total focus.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I knelt down beneath a columned threshold of cracked marble when we reached the last step. A large crater flattened the mountaintop, and was filled with a lake of poisoned water. Rocky ridges made up the sides like the caldera of a volcano. Bright, purple sludge gurgled up like a spring in the very center of the basin, concentrating the toxin befouling the lake water. The landscape was devoid of life save for the monsters that made the basin their cursed home. Lifeless husks of trees sat like gravestones in the lake. Leaves, branches, carcasses, and other detritus floated along the walls, pushed there by the poisonous spring.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Crude structures, sitting on wooden poles and large boulders, were built over the water. The large host of lizalfos milled about with a variety of cruel weapons, making armor, feasting on carrion, or bickering amongst themselves. Near the burbling liquid at the center was what looked like a ceremonial pillar of stone on which images of deku, monkeys, and humans were carved. At the top stood a more elegant and ancient platform with an outcropping hanging just above the poison spring. There was no sign of any temple though. My stomach twisted with a quiet frustration—maybe Tatl was right after all, and we’d come all this way for nothing. Still, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was hidden, that we were just missing a piece of the puzzle. The flame of determination I had clung to flickered, but I held it tight. There had to be more beneath the surface, or maybe the entrance was through the small cave on the opposite side of the lake. Only one way to know for sure, we had to go through the army of lizard soldiers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So… you said you had a plan?" Tatl whispered after she found where my head was.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ummm….I did. But, that's way too many for me to handle. Looks like this cloak is going to be of use after all…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No, I'm sick of hiding beneath that thing. It's even worse than your other one!" Tatl chimed in annoyance. "Think of another way!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh come on, it can't be that bad." I berated and ducked behind a crumbled wall. "Unless you can think of another way, it's best that you stay out of sight. It looked like some of them were carrying bows and arrows."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Pfft, like they can hit a tiny little fairy. Besides, if I fly out there and distract them, it'll let you sneak past."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"And…. you're ok with putting yourself in harm's way?" I dubiously asked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl looked toward the sound of my voice, her glow flickering with uncertainty as she tried to find my eyes beyond the nearly invisible hood. For a heartbeat, she hesitated—then steadied herself, as if sealing her resolve in that fleeting glance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I, er...yeah I guess I am. Seeing you in action, ignoring any fear, has kinda inspired me. And helping you at the camp back there was quite thrilling, I can't just...sit around and hide behind you anymore." She replied in a nervous tone. "It's time I learn to fight anyway, so that I can repay Skull Kid for abusing my brother like he did…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I removed the hood, briefly, so that she could see my somber expression—brows furrowed, lips pressed into a thin line, the weight of too many fights hanging heavy behind my eyes. Pride mingled with dread in my chest; I didn't want her walking this road, but I couldn't deny the fierce spark of courage I saw in her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Look...fighting isn't an easy path to take. Look where it's gotten me, for example. And it takes a lot of practice to get any good at it. This really isn't the time t-"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey I didn't say I wanted to conquer the world!" Tatl interrupted. "I just don't want to be so helpless anymore."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ugh, fine…" I flung the hood up again, shaking my head. "Just be careful, I won't be able to save you if you get in trouble."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Sheesh… okay mom! I'll be careful." Tatl snarked and flew off into the crater.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"She just can't help herself…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I grumbled and walked toward the first platform sitting on the ridge.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A few lizalfos were sitting around a campfire, cooking what appeared to be the remains of a hog. Sneaking past them was simple, since they were occupied with tearing apart their meal with gnashing fangs. The second platform was just as easy, but the group was sparring and one errant swing of a polearm just barely missed gashing my face open. I silently dodged and quickened my pace.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">When I reached the third platform, Tatl decided to start her distraction by tossing small pebbles onto a few of the confused monsters. I couldn't help but feel a strange mix of admiration and concern watching her—boldly darting straight into danger with a fire in her heart, when moments ago she was afraid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ha! Take that, you wart-faced toads!" The fairy taunted and dropped another pebble. "That'll teach you to mess with me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The lizalfos hissed and shook a clawed fist, spurring on its brethren.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"We gotsss target practice again! Shoot the twinkly! Winner getsss double ration!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I took advantage of the opportunity and tiptoed around the lizard bowmen as they fired off crude, unbalanced arrows at the offending fairy. Thankfully, their aim was terrible and Tatl danced around the projectiles with little difficulty, dropping more pebbles and taunting the monsters.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">The third platform had multiple bridges connecting to different paths. One way led to the cave, another led to their sleeping quarters, and the last seemed to lead to the ancient pillar in the center. I decided to explore the cave, and stepped onto the narrow wooden bridge. One of the lizalfos jumped on it from the other side, focusing on shooting down Tatl. I gave it a little shove just before it released its arrow, and it shrieked as it fell into the dark water below. The toxic liquid bubbled and steamed around the monster as it screamed in pain. Its former comrades laughed. They watched the hapless lizalfos dissolve and dissipate like it was nothing. </span>
      <span class="c12 c26 c6 c8">Barbarians.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hehhhehh, ssstupid! Watch where you walk next time!" One of them mocked the sinking body.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hahhhh! No next time for you!" Another laughed and pointed, and I felt a wave of cold revulsion rise in me. The cruelty, the delight they took in each other’s pain—it made something harden inside me, something that wouldn’t be so easy to shake.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The others resumed their clumsy target practice on Tatl just before I reached the rocky ground of the cave, still making a game of it. I hoped that the fairy wouldn't get cocky and take an arrow, but judging from their atrocious aim it would literally be a long shot.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I stepped into the cave, which was lit with torches made of tough-cut wood. Piles of bone and burnt, half-eaten carcasses were scattered all over the floor. I could hear jeering insults coming from further within, and I decided to investigate. Taking care not to disturb the bones, I soon discovered where the deep, raspy tones originated.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Fool! Ignorant, halfwitted coward! An entire camp defeated by a lone swordsman?" The brusque voice growled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"N-no, your Fierceness!" The voice sounded just like the lizalfos from the camp. "He was sword Master! He moved like demon and kill-"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Enough, pondslime! No excuses, you know what happens to those that fail me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Please, Lord Grixos! N-n-nooo! Give me- AAUUGHHH!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Sickening sounds of tearing flesh and cracking bone resonated through the cave as the screams of the lizalfos abruptly ceased. I reached the innermost cavern just to see the upper half of the lizard beast being thrown towards me, and I sidestepped quietly as the body sailed past and splattered against the wall.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Two armored spearmen cowered at the entrance, and looking past them I could understand why. A very large creature, nearly ten times my size, covered in spiny scales and a long, spiked tail...hunched over the remains of the lizalfos, gnashing through bone and sinew with a sickening crunch</span>
      <span> </span>
      <span class="c2">Chandeliers made from a variety of skulls were bolted to the top of the cave by chains, and what looked like a fountain of foul, brackish water lay at the back. Black scorch marks lined the walls like clawed fingers of shadow, curling and creeping across the stone. The scent of burnt minerals and something darker—like scorched flesh or sulfur—hung in the air. It wasn’t just fire that left these marks; it felt like hatred, old and violent, had once raged here, leaving behind a warning in charcoal and heat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6 c8">That must be the dinolfos…</span>
      <span class="c6"> I thought to myself, sneaking past the guards. </span>
      <span class="c12 c26 c6 c8">If I can slay him, maybe all the others will run.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">As soon as I entered the room, the huge lizard lord paused in its feast, sniffing around.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wait… What's that smell?" It boomed at the shaking underlings. "Smells like….like a human. Where is it!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No human here, boss! We see no one!" replied one of the spearmen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I can smell it, you idiots, it's in here somewhere." The leader stood, sniffing closer and stomping towards me. "Come out, little human! No use in hiding, accept your fate!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Slitted, yellow-green eyes focused on right where I was standing, and a hissing laugh escaped from its fanged jaws.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hhhhaahhhaaaa… very very clever. Why don't you remove that odd cloak and show your face, or I'll flambé you where you stand."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The game was up, and I knew my cover was blown. I urgently formulated a plan as I removed the hood and placed the cloak on the filthy cave floor. The dinolfos crouched down to get a closer look, and I squinted back welling tears as its putrid, hot breath burned my eyes and nostrils.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Interesting… I wasn't expecting such a tiny creature like you. I wonder…. What's your purpose here, young one?" The dinolfos mused, clearly thinking I was helpless.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh you know, just taking in the sights. Nice place you have here." I remarked sarcastically. "The bones give it a good, homey feeling!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">If the great lizard had lips, they would be smiling. Grixos breathed a heavy, sweltering laugh.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hhhhaahhhaaaa! You have great courage, I'll give you that! Much greater than those sniveling toads out there. I can appreciate your bravery… In fact I'll even grant you a quick death, which I assure you is preferable to facing the mighty Odalwa. Yet you have not answered my question."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ah, right…well...umm"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I frantically thought and suddenly remembered the circus performers</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I heard about your greatness from the weak and pitiful deku, and I seek to entertain your lordship!" I bowed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The beast glowered at me, narrowing its gaze.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"A tiny human girl comes all this way, merely to entertain me? Do you think me brainless? That is the most ridiculous story I've heard today… and that's saying much."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"It's true, your fierceness! I am but a humble performer aspiring to entertain those who can't witness it anywhere else! See?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I leapt into the air with a twisting backflip, wincing slightly as my bow knocked against my head, and landed with a flourish.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The huge reptile raked a talon along its jaw in thought, growling menacingly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"If you are being truthful, and really are an entertainer, you have still thoughtlessly wasted your life. Why don't you just be a good little human, and let me hastily end you. It's been a long while since I've tasted the sweet flesh of your kind…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Dribble flowed from the scaly mouth as its clawed hand began to reach down. I rolled to the side quickly to avoid being dinner.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh I'll be more than happy to accept your kindness." I said and slowly started going for my mask. "But at least let me entertain you first, Great Lord!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The dinolfos lunged at me once more, and I leapt back and held the mask to my face. The claws drew close and, as soon as I felt the sword return, I drew the blade across the lizard's open palm. The beast halted and clutched at its bleeding hand, hissing in pain. It glared at me as tendrils of smoke began to rise from its nostrils.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ahhh… Now that is a trick I've not seen before. Very good, human. But you have sealed your doom!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A stream of fire erupted from the dinolfos' mouth, singeing my tunic as I barely managed to escape. The spiked tail swung towards me and I raised my shield, bracing for impact. The strike wasn't forceful enough to knock me away, so I brought down my sword and cleaved a deep gash through the tail. Scalding flames burst toward me once more as the dinolfos roared with furious slashing. I leapt before the entrance with the flames following close behind, and the lizalfos' standing guard fled the cavern to avoid being roasted alive.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Arghhh! You must be that swordsman that destroyed my scout camp! What kind of creature are you?" The dinolfos bellowed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I didn't bother answering, opting to press my advantage instead. I ducked inside the dinolfos' reach in order to slash at its heavily muscled legs, but the monster lizard jumped away releasing another blast of flame from its mouth. I was trapped, and the fountain of tepid water behind me was the only way to escape being torched. I quickly rolled into the water just before the flames reached me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The fountain yawned beneath me—far deeper than I expected. It swallowed me whole, but it also saved my skin. A light suddenly appeared in the dark depths, and its green glow intensified. I immediately regretted my decision to jump into the fountain. I was trapped, the water above beginning to boil from the ferocity of the flames, and the ghostly light beneath getting brighter. I needed to get out, feeling my lungs straining with the lack of oxygen, and glanced around for any odd openings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Young warrior, have you come to free me?" A musical voice chimed clearly in the deep.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The light encompassed me and suddenly I could breathe again, even though I was still submerged. I gulped in precious air and answered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhh...I don't know -cough cough-. Who are you?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The green glow dimmed for a second, then shimmered as the voice spoke again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"It's not safe to talk. Defeat Grixos and I can tell you all I know…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The pool darkened once again, but as the light faded so did my air supply. I glanced up, hoping the river of flame ceased, and was relieved to see my hope fulfilled. I watched the dinolfos peer into the pool, then it turned to stomp away in satisfaction.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Now was my chance for a surprise attack! I rushed up and out of the steaming water with a splash, sprinted to the monster and plunged my blade into its spiked back! Grixos loosed a thunderous roar, and fire spewed from its mouth. A massive claw grabbed me, and I felt stomach-churning weightlessness as I went flying.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The impact of me pounding against the wall knocked the breath from my lungs, possibly breaking ribs, but remaining still would result in certain death. A wall of flame surged towards me and I jumped away with all the energy I had left. When I landed on the ground, still winded and gasping, I reached for my sword to find it gone. I panicked and searched the disgusting cave floor, only to notice my hands and body had transformed again. I groaned in frustration, the sudden shift tugging at my insides in a way that didn’t shock me anymore...but still left me shaken, as if I’d just shed someone else’s skin. It was getting harder to remember which shape felt most like home.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ohhh you have got to be kidding meEEEAGHH!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I shrieked in surprise when my feet lifted from the ground, plucked up by the furious dinolfos like a tiny kitten.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You are...truly a unique little human!" Grixos bellowed, dangling me before its eyes. "I've never had such a worthy challenger before, and I must congratulate you! But the battle is over, you have no sword to strike with now. Before I devour you whole, however,"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Grixos growled with a twisted grin...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I would very much like to know your name. A worthy adversary should not go unnamed, after all. Only the fiercest flames... deserve to taste the names of their prey.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The pain in my chest was amplified as I hung there, coughing up a tiny stream of warm liquid as I fought for breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Why *cough* ugh… why do you want to know?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Consider it an honor, by all means you deserve that at least." Grixos rumbled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I reached behind, struggling to grasp my bow. When I finally got a solid grip, I defiantly stared the great lizard in its huge slitted eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"It's Link!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">In one fluid, desperate motion, I yanked the bow forward, string taut with purpose, and unleashed a radiant bolt of energy straight into Grixos’s glaring eye. The beast shrieked—an awful, reverberating wail that shook the cavern—and flung me aside. I landed hard, rolled, and rose into a crouch, chest burning, hands trembling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Grixos reeled, clutching at its blinded eye, but I didn’t hesitate. Gritting my teeth, I drew again. One arrow. Then another. Each one a cry of defiance, of pain, of refusal to fall here. I kept firing into the monster’s gaping maw, each strike glowing brighter, until at last a final arrow struck deep—and the lizard lord gave a choking gasp. Its massive body convulsed, then sagged forward with a heavy crash. The crackling the flames in the room slowly died. And then—only silence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I collapsed to the ground, utterly spent from the intense battle. Relief flooded me in a dizzying wave, mixing with the sharp ache of bruises and the lingering burn of adrenaline. My arms trembled as I pressed my palms into the damp stone, the taste of blood still faint in my mouth. For a brief moment, all I could do was breathe—and even that felt like a fragile luxury. I blinked away sweat and blood, still breathing heavily, when I remembered my fallen mask. I moaned and stood to my feet, saw the wooden visage laying next to a broken pile of bones, and limped over to retrieve it, stepping over a dark green pool of blood forming around the fallen lizard's body.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ugghhhh…. so that was a dinolfos. If only I had some bombs…urgh."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I grunted as I leaned over and fastened the mask to my belt again, then sat back down. I didn't care if the floor was covered in decaying bodies, I just needed a chance to catch my breath. I shut my eyes momentarily to calm the adrenaline, and tried to slow my pained, shaky breathing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c12 c26 c6 c8">Yup, there must be a few ribs broken. Fantastic…</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A pale green glow emanated from the fountain, warm and shimmering like mist caught in sunlight. It spread with a gentle hum, casting dancing reflections across the cavern walls and softening the sharp stench of scorched stone with a hint of mossy sweetness. A few dozen fairies emerged from the waters and flitted over to me, cheering in unison.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Strange, but courageous hero, you have freed me from the cruelty of Lord Grixos! How can I repay you? Your valor must be rewarded!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ah great… more shattered fairies." I muttered, holding a hand to my damp forehead. "Umm…look. I appreciate the sentiment, but I've really gotta get going. Unless you know where to find the temple around here, or at least heal me, I'm not sure how you can help."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"The temple? You must mean Woodfall…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yes, that's where I need to go. From what I've gathered, it's the lair of the monster that's terrorizing this swamp."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"That monster is actually the guardian of this land. A masked child of the forest stole his power, and transformed him into the very thing he was called to protect against. A very cruel joke... but with that act, my power was also sapped away and I was broken. I am quite useless now, unfortunately."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well, I suppose that seems to be how Skull Kid uses his powers… to him, his actions are nothing more than jokes. I assume I can't just slay Odalwa now…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No you cannot slay a Guardian. But by destroying his cursed form, you would free his spirit, thus restoring peace to the swamp." The fairies twinkled in unison. "The temple lies beneath the lake, but it will rise if the ceremonial bell is rung."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'm guessing that's at the top of that pillar…" I sighed and stood up. "Hokay then, guess I'll be going now."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh, wait! I have to give you at least something for destroying that infernal creature. Wait just a moment…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A single fairy flew back into the fountain, and quickly returned holding a small, shiny trinket.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Humans fancy things like this, yes? It was given to me as an offering long ago, and I have no use for it." The tiny green fairy dropped the item into my hand. "Please take it as a token of eternal gratitude!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The trinket was actually an elegant gold ring, its band warm to the touch and etched with tiny runes that shimmered faintly beneath the surface. Small rubies circled the middle, each one catching the torchlight like a living ember. As I turned it in my hand, I felt a curious twinge—part awe, part unease—as though it was watching me back. The metal band looked a little big, yet I slipped it on my left ring finger anyway. It was a very loose fit, but just before I moved to take it off, the ring glistened and somehow shrunk itself into a perfect fit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmmm… interesting." I mused as I lifted my hand. "Magic rings are always nice, thank you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'm afraid that's all I can give. But should you be victorious and return this land to normal, please return to this fountain. I will be able to bestow some of my power to you, which will surely assist in the future."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Umm...ok. That's better than nothing I-"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I paused and raised my bow at the sound of footsteps coming down the corridor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The two lizalfos guards returned to the entrance, looking around in horror at the massive body. I drew back the bowstring, and to my astonishment, a red bolt of flame sparked to life—hot, crackling, and fierce. The searing hiss of heat filled the air, and the rubies in the ring shimmered with a pulsing glow, as if awakened by my intent. For a heartbeat, I could feel the heat radiating off the magical flame, pulsing in my fingers like it was alive. The rubies within the ring were ablaze with tiny flames themselves, and I accidentally released the fiery arrow in my surprise. The bolt exploded in an inferno right beside the lizalfos guards, and they screeched in terror, dropping their spears and tripping over each other to flee for their lives down the corridor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ha! That's more like it…urrgh." I grimaced in pain and lowered the bow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh my, you're hurt! You must rest, hero friend!" The fairies swirled around me in concern.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No, I'll be fine. I think this other mask will supposedly heal me, so don't worry." I reassured, "But thank you again for the added... 'firepower'.. haha!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I honestly had no idea, it was always just a piece of metal to me. I'm very glad that I was able to help though."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Nodding my gratitude to the fairies, I hobbled over to the corner where I dropped the hide, which was definitely living up to its name. After a few seconds of scrounging around the vile ground, I found it and hoisted it to my shoulder. It would definitely need a good cleaning after all this... but I couldn't help cracking a small, grim smile. Despite everything, I was still standing—and for the first time since entering this festering swamp, I felt like I had a real shot at saving it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oooff… Alright, I need to get a move on. I'll return if I survive this fight."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Very well, I like your attitude. Such a go-getter!" The fairies giggled together and drifted back to the fountain. "Again, I wish you luck. I have faith you'll succeed!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">And with that the fairies vanished into the dark waters. Seeing nothing left to do, I made my way towards the exit, ready to be out of the stinking cave. It was finally time to face Odalwa.</span>

    <h1 class="c25" id="h.kixz7sbbehy6">
      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">The Blighted Temple</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c24 c20">
      <span class="c9 c16 c8 c32">
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">By the time I left the cave, the entire host of lizalfos was in chaotic disarray. As soon as I stepped from the shadows, the creatures noticed and scrambled over each other to flee. More than a few of them fell into the corrosive waters and their screams of agony were drowned out by the general retreat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl, who was still flying above the lake, spotted me as well and rushed down to my side.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Where did you go? I couldn't find you anywhere!" The fairy jabbered on, "And what happened to you? Why are all these dummies running around like crazed cuckoos?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well, long story short, I think I killed their leader… who happened to be one of those dinolfos." I answered and cringed when I gently tapped my broken ribs. "I guess I took a few good hits, but don't worry. This deku mask will hopefully patch me up."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The Deku mask fitted neatly to my face, its wooden surface cool against my skin. As the magic took hold, a soothing warmth seeped into my bones, like sunlight pouring through a fog. My aching ribs eased with a gentle tingling sensation, as though invisible hands were knitting my wounds back together. The weight of exhaustion lightened just enough for me to breathe fully again, the pain beginning to melt into a distant echo.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wow…. the things I miss when I'm not with you for only an hour." Tatl jokingly moped, then glanced at my hands. "Hey, nice ring by the way! Is there a treasure trove in there or something?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmmm? Oh right, this thing. If you count dead bodies and skeletons as treasure, then yes just piles of it!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ewww you took that from a corpse? Gross!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No! Nothing like that! A bunch of fairies gave it to me. I think that could be another Great Fairy fountain..." I casually remarked as the pain receded from my thoughts, relaxing in the faint yet warm energy of the sun hiding behind the bleak clouds above.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Huh… I had heard rumors of a fountain in the southern swamp, but I figured they were just tall tales."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well they're true. Ahh… this feels amazing..." Came my muffled reply as my body went numb.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey come on now, focus!" The fairy chimed and clapped her hands. "Did she tell you anything else?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I was becoming oddly sleepy, but answered Tatl's distant query. "Yeah, we gotta get to the temple...or something...mmm."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What temple? There's nothing here except rotten garbage and poisoned water…. Hello? Are you listening? Link!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Her voice drifted away in muted silence, in fact all the sounds around me faded away. Yet I didn't pay it any mind, I was far too comfortable to care. I shut my eyes and drifted into a deep sleep… though something in the way it overtook me felt wrong. The warmth from the mask, once soothing, grew strangely heavy—as if wrapping me in vines that tightened ever so slightly with each breath. My limbs felt weighted, thoughts fogged, and the usual whispers of the world dulled into silence. It wasn’t simple tiredness. It was as though something ancient and unseen had gently, irresistibly rooted me in place, and I was too weary to fight back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">All of a sudden, the world rushed back and I felt the soft wood of the mask pull away from my face, with Tatl twinkling over me in fearful concern.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wake up! Come on wake up, Link! Link??"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">My companion began to frantically tug at me and, slowly, groggily, I sat up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Calm down, Tatl. What's wrong?" I yawned loudly and the fairy ceased her hair-pulling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You passed out and fell to the ground! I thought for sure you were a goner when you didn't move or answer. It must have been this thing!" She threw down the demi mask in disgust. "It's filled with who knows what kind of magic, and obviously dangerous! All of these crazy masks are!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What? I don't remember falling…" I paused and realized I was sitting on the boardwalk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well... regardless of the danger, at least you're not as bruised and beat up anymore. I was terrified, Link—I thought you were gone. When you passed out like that and didn’t move, I—I panicked. It healed you, sure, but it also seemed to be paralyzing you. You were barely breathing. It’s like... it was feeding off you while it fixed you. That thing might be powerful, but it’s also dangerous... seriously dangerous. Please, just... remember what the Mask Salesman said. These masks have minds of their own sometimes."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yes yes, I remember, it's impossible to forget..." I sighed and picked the mask up, brushing off the muck. "I don't know why you're so worked up about it though."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I stood up and started walking forward past the fairy when an unexpected outburst sounded from Tatl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Why?! It's because you-!….well…" her tiny voice paused, "You're…. the closest thing I have to a friend…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">The pixie's quiet sincerity caught me off guard, stopping me in my tracks like a sudden gust of wind. I glanced back in surprise, her words stirring something raw and fragile inside me—a flicker of recognition, maybe even guilt. For a moment, the din of danger and masks faded, and I felt the rare, delicate weight of being seen. I didn’t just hear her—I </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">felt</span>
      <span class="c2"> her. The hurt, the loneliness, the hope. It cracked through my armor in a place I hadn’t realized was soft. I didn't know how to respond, so I stared at her in awkward silence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I...I don't have many friends." Tatl continued somberly, her voice trembling at the edges. "Well, actually, now I don't have any… And I've never met a human like...you...before. Most humans give up the second trouble comes calling, but you… you keep going, despite all you've been through. Even though I taunt you and make fun of you… you're still here. You didn't leave…unlike everyone else. And because of that, I consider you as my one and only friend."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I didn't expect those words to hit so hard...but they did, cutting past all the hard scars within my heart that a hero's life had put there. I looked at the tiny creature—my companion, my guide, my unexpected confidante—and a slow smile formed across my face as I stepped toward her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Wait, are you telling me we </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">aren’t</span>
      <span class="c2"> friends yet? Pfft, I considered us to be friends before we even left Clock Town."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You… did?" She paused, her wings fluttering nervously. She studied my face for any trace of mockery and, finding none, returned my smile. "Ya know, this is how you get yourself in trouble, dummy. You're far too trusting, hehe."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah well, so are you!" I teased, waving my hands playfully and pretending to catch her. "I could easily squish you like a beetle."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Okay okay, sheesh! Knock it off before you </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">do</span>
      <span class="c2"> flatten me!" She zipped away with a mock-squeal, circling back a few times in exaggerated panic. "What would you do then, huh? You wouldn't have any idea what to do next without me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Our laughter echoed through the fog-thick air—short-lived, maybe, but real. And real was rare. For that breath of a moment, the world was less heavy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Then it returned. I snapped my fingers, suddenly remembering our task—our </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">mission</span>
      <span class="c2">. The swamp still needed saving, and it wasn’t going to wait for two new friends to finish their heart-to-heart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh right! The fairies in that cave said the temple was hidden underneath this lake, and to ring a gong to reveal it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"A gong? I think I saw something like that on that rock tower over there." She pointed at an old pillar rising from the middle of the lake.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yep, that's probably the one." Slinging the camouflaged hide over my shoulders, I began walking. "Let's go teach that monster a lesson."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl agreed and we maneuvered around heaps of garbage and waste strewn throughout the now deserted camp. Several scaly bodies were dissolving in the caustic lake below us, their flesh sloughing off like melted wax into the greenish sludge. Tendrils of acrid smoke coiled up from the bubbling surface, choking the air with a stench that reminded me of burning hair and rotting meat. I gagged reflexively, the bitter taste of bile rising in my throat, but I forced it down—there was no time to dwell on the horrors of this scene, not now</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">When we arrived near the stone column in the center, the wooden path to the top had been destroyed and ended in a splintered mess. If there was any way to reach the top, I'd have to jump and climb the craggy pillar walls. After a clap and rub of my hands, I took a deep breath, steeling myself against the jolt of fear that twisted in my gut. My heart pounded, and the sweat on my palms made the leap feel even riskier. But there was no other choice—I had to try. I leapt across the gap, barely catching the rough edges with my thin fingers. I tried to keep my eyes skyward, avoiding any thoughts of falling into the acidic poison below as a surprised Tatl zipped over.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Whoa whoa! Easy there! You didn't tell me you were going to jump!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What…urghh… other way do you think… ugh..there is?" I panted out as I climbed, which was not an easy feat with the heavy cloak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"I know, but </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">geez! </span>
      <span class="c2">You could give me a warning next time!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"OK...fair enough… Whew!" I grunted as I pulled myself up over the ledge.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The top of the pillar had three statues of a Deku, a Monkey, and a Human positioned around a central ring, representing the three races of the swamp. Within the middle ring was a large, stone owl holding a rusted bronze gong within its open beak. A golden mallet rested on a thin pedestal built beside the statue's spread wings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well, here goes nothing… " I shrugged to Tatl and picked up the astonishingly light hammer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Swinging the mallet with all the strength I had, the gong tolled with a deep </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">BWOOOOONNNNNNNG!</span>
      <span class="c2"> that reverberated through the entire crater. I braced myself on one of the human statues as the area began to shake and rumble. A few moments later, large ripples formed in the middle of the lake as the quaking intensified. The ripples became great waves and soon a mountainous pyramid erupted from the roiling waters! Tatl and I took cover under the widespread wings of the owl statue as purple sludge rained down from the monumental structure as it continued to rise with waterfalls pouring from its ridges and openings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Finally the shaking calmed and the temple ceased its ascent. A stone bridge extended and rumbled from the middle of the column and thudded against the temple entrance, and a massive stone door rose open, grinding into place and revealing a dark passageway into the pyramid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Um… right. I guess we found the temple." Tatl declared in awe as I moved out from under the owl's wings. "Yeah, ok, I'll just...uhh... follow after you…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh come now, it's not that bad! It's just a dark tunnel leading into a building that's likely filled with monsters, and a giant undead warrior probably lying in wait as well." I scoffed and headed across the bridge. "But thanks for letting me go first into an ancient doorway that won't lead to my doom…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The fairy slowly followed after me. "Well...you know what they say, ladies first."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I stopped at the entrance, rolling my eyes and mock-glared at the fairy. I made a gesture with my hands like I was crushing a bug, and Tatl feigned a hurt expression. She soon zipped under the scaled hide when a deep growl suddenly emanated from the black depths. I drew the deep hood of the scaly cloak over my head, swallowing hard as I stepped forward. A pulse of unease beat against my ribs, but I forced it down—fear wouldn't help me here. I set my jaw, clenched my fists, and walked into the darkness with a fierce determination, daring whatever lay ahead to try and break me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The air grew colder as we stepped deeper inside, and even our footsteps sounded wrong....swallowed too quickly by the oppressive stillness. Inside the temple, wall-sconces were lit with dim, pale-yellow flames. The ground was slick with reddish-brown algae, and overgrown vines coated in spiderwebs hung overhead. Swathes of purple ooze mixed with the algae in lengthy patches down the hall. To either side of us were high walls of mossy brick depicting time-worn images of humans, lizalfos, monkeys, and deku fighting amongst burning trees and dwellings. Sounds of eerie clanging, originating from the temple depths, echoed around us as I continued down the hall, and the chiseled images shifted to a scene of the humans allying with the deku and monkey tribes to chase away the army of monsters. A giant humanoid with dark eyes and bizarrely elongated limbs jointed to a small, round body rose up behind the tribes, but any further images were destroyed by deep, scouring gashes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The ambient noises around us grew louder as the hallway expanded into a great chamber filled with darkness. I could vaguely see the edges of trees or roots within the room, but something caught my eye as it shifted in the shadows. I peered closer, and watched intently as I stepped beyond the hall and entered the room. My foot caught on a root or vine and I stumbled forward, cursing my clumsiness when all of a sudden, hundreds of tiny red eyes appeared and turned to see whatever foolish creature had just entered their domain. I backed away slowly, stepping carefully, as it was apparent that the monsters couldn't see me and I wanted to keep it that way.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Tatl," I quietly summoned the fairy. "Do you know what these things are?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What?" The fairy peeked out from behind the cloak. "I've never seen anything like that…. what do we do?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I say we sneak around them, they can't see us…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Not realizing that Tatl had given us away with her luminescent body, I jumped when the creatures squeaked loudly in alarm and began to move toward us like a blanket of pure shadow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Aaaand </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">now</span>
      <span class="c2"> they see us." I reached for my bow and worked it out from under the cloak. "Let's see if they like fire!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl flew out from cover as I drew back the string, "Fire? What do you-"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">She didn't have a chance to finish when the ring flashed with the first launched arrow, catching the magic bolt ablaze. Bright flashes of piercing flames incinerated groups of the dark balls as I shot arrow after arrow. The new ring I'd found was growing hotter and hotter after each fiery blast. Finally, after shooting off one last bolt, the burning projectile took out whatever few creatures remained and the room was empty save for us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I think that's the last of th-...Agghhh!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I shrieked at the searing heat on my finger and frantically flung the white-hot ring to the ground, letting the bow clatter to the stone floor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What happened?" Tatl twinkled and flew out. " Did you get bit or something?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I slipped my glove off and caressed my blistering finger, shaking heavy the hood from my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No! The damn ring practically caught fire and burned me! It just caught me off guard..." I grumbled and stuck the throbbing finger into my mouth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You weren't the only one caught off guard! How'd you do that?" The fairy inquired as she focused her attention on the dimming ring. "I didn't know you could use fire."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"The ring is imbued with fire magic. I guess it affects magic weapons too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Odd… it's crazy how you find all these things. I never found anything like that before I met you, and we sure coulda used your luck...oh...I didn't mean-."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Eh…" I shrugged and pulled on the glove and hood before placing the warm ring on a different finger. "It's a curse…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Just then, a slow, steady shuffling grew louder as a massive shape began to materialize within the gloom of the temple. The stench of a thousand corpses filled my nostrils, thick and cloying, like rotting meat left in stagnant water under a summer sun. It triggered a sharp gag reflex and pulled an old memory to the surface—a battlefield outside Castle Town, where the wind had carried a similar fetid reek. My stomach turned as the air thickened, suffocating and heavy, sticking to the inside of my throat like tar., made even worse by the tepid air, and I knew... Odalwa had come.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl chimed in fear and rushed back into my cloak, and the cursed being noticed the movement. I frantically searched for cover as the hulking monster lunged toward the me, and I barely managed to dive behind a hanging root before the jagged blade created sparks where I stood not a second before, knocking my bow across the room. I silently cursed myself for not picking up the bow sooner, hidden behind the camouflaged hood, while Odalwa moaned in rage of losing its target. Loud gasps of air sucked into the wooden mask as it sniffed around, hunting us, and I tightly gripped the witch's medallion that hung around my neck, holding my breath as the monster passed us by.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I waited for the beast to get some distance before daring to move again, and silently skittered to another tree. My blue fairy bow was lying on the floor directly across from me, unfortunately Odalwa was right beside it. I crouched as low as I could, and slowly tried to get a bit closer while looking for more cover. There wasn't much. From what I could see now that my eyes were more adjusted to the darkness, the high ceiling was held up by six stone pillars covered in vines that I mistook before as tree roots. Unlit torches in sconces were situated around the eight walls, which made the room a large octagon with two exits. One exit was where we entered, the other had no telling of where it led to and was unfortunately being watched by Odalwa. If I could only get to my bow without being discovered, I could at least fight back. I felt my small partner stir around my arm and I very faintly shushed her, thankfully she got the message and remained silent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Other than the noxious, heavy breathing of the monster, the temple was deathly still and silent. I painstakingly inched forward bit by bit, each movement bringing me closer to either my weapon or to my doom. I could feel beads of sweat forming on my forehead from the humid chamber, and I tried unsuccessfully to swipe them away. I rounded the edge of the pillar closest to the weapon, and Odalwa, so focused on my foot placement that I didn't see the dry tiny root hanging near my head. The twig snapped as I brushed by it, a sound like thunder in the quiet chamber, and Odalwa unleashed a horrifying bellow and rushed forth, thrusting its blade wildly about towards the noise.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Abandoning my stealthy approach, I sprinted as fast as I could to the fallen bow, buffeting Tatl around within my cloak while doing my best to dodge the mad assault. I reached out for the magic weapon, letting instinct take over as I flipped it up into my hands, rolled backwards and aimed directly for the undead giant's mask. The bright, flaming bolt of energy lit up the room like the sun, accompanied by a thunderous </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">crack</span>
      <span class="c2"> that echoed through the chamber and sent a rush of heat and air rippling outward from the point of impact. catching the monster's attention as it trampled towards me in blind fury. The bolt sailed through the darkness and exploded upon contact with the hard wood of the mask. Thick, acrid smoke filled the room, clawing down my throat and scalding my lungs with each breath. The stench of scorched rot clung to the air, and the heat surged in chaotic waves, making my head spin. My boots scraped blindly over the stone floor as I stumbled away from the screeching monster, heart hammering, senses overwhelmed by the searing, smoke-choked darkness. Aside from the flaming giant, seeing anything within the smoke-filled darkness of the chamber was near impossible now, and I fumbled around on all fours, feeling around with my hands as I struggled to breath. I looked back to vaguely see Odalwa tearing away its burning mask. It was bashing its way into pillars and walls, making the temple grounds tremble. I managed to spot one of the torches lining the walls, I had to see where I was going so I caught another bolt on fire and let it fly, setting the torch ablaze. Although the smoke refracted most of the light, I could at least see my surroundings now. I was also far enough away from Odalwa that I could shoot it again with more precise aim. I readied the bow, once more aiming for the mask of the flailing monster, and took the shot. Odalwa must have seen the arrow zipping towards it and raised its shield. The arrow was effortlessly deflected and immediately extinguished. I fired off a few more bolts but they were useless against the raised shield, and the monster began to move forward.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Now what!?" Tatl shouted fearfully, now apparently out of cover. "What do we do? Run away?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I glanced toward the exit . Odalwa must have read my mind because it looked at the exit too, and leapt up in an astonishingly agile move.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Nope, not anymore!" I answered and backed into the wall.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I could swear I heard the monster wheeze out a heaving laugh and it stepped closer, blocking off any chance of escape with its blade.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Well you have to do </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">something!</span>
      <span class="c2">" The fairy cried, "Put on your mask!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhh I'll try, see if you can distract him!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl made a noise that was part fear, part annoyance, and part determination, and darted around Odalwa's head, who proceeded to swat at her like a fly. I groped at my mask and hurriedly slapped it to my face. After the now-familiar cracking and reshaping between forms, I rushed at the monster with sword drawn and shield ready, ignoring the burning in my lungs from the smoky room. Odalwa saw me coming but was clearly caught off guard, and raised its shield only just before I dealt a hefty blow. The impact shook my arm only a little, but I still kept swinging, dodging, blocking, and swinging again, caught within a deadly waltz.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">After what seemed like hours, I finally managed to whittle away at the huge shield until it was nothing but splinters. Odalwa moaned in angry disbelief and jumped back. I dashed at it once more, but it faded into a dark mist, and my sword slashed nothing but smoke and air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What? Where did he go!" I called out to Tatl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Umm…. Ummm…" She looked and flitted around, "I don't know, I can't see anything in here! It's too dark...woah look out!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I heard the whoosh just as my companion spoke out, and rolled to the side. My heavier weight made the maneuver more difficult and I didn't get very far, but I dodged the weapon just the same. I turned to face my attacker, which was a bulkier lizalfos in steel armor and a curved sword that was more sickle than sword, and it came at me once more. I knocked aside its blade, and tried to run it through. But it flipped through the air on powerful legs and nearly knocked my head off with a sharp attachment on its tail. I took a mental note and immediately attacked, not giving it a chance to recover. The lizalfos must've been expecting a deathblow with its tail strike, and didn't turn around fast enough. I sliced through the tail and left foot, spun, and with a twist of my wrist the reptilian head went spinning along the stone floor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Suddenly, the lit torch of the room went out and we were cast in darkness. We began to hear an eerie chanting echo through the chamber, and the shadows seemed to coagulate and form into vague outlines of more lizalfos. One of them must have jumped at me as a sharp stinging pain drew across my shield arm. I lashed out with my sword and felt a cool splash wash over me, indicating a successful blow I assumed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link, use your bow! Hurry!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I heard the fairy and knew exactly what she was thinking, I plucked off my mask, heart pounding like a war drum in my chest, and awkwardly dashed away from the army of darkness. My breath came in sharp, panicked gasps as I felt my body twist and shrink back to its natural state, each bone and tendon pulling inward like a tightening coil. The sensation was no longer painful, but eerily smooth—like a memory being reversed. The sudden lightness in my frame made me stagger, and I couldn’t tell if it was relief or dread that filled me. My fingers trembled as I reached out to steady myself, the world tilting from the shift, the adrenaline clawing at my throat as shadows reached for me with hungry fingers. There was no time to think—only to flee, to regroup, to survive....to give me more time. Tatl's light helped a little in dodging shadowy assaults, but it wasn't nearly enough in the smoky room. Thankfully I soon felt the bow appear on my back again, and feeling much lighter on my feet I jumped forward and shot off an arrow directly behind me. Thin yelps of the incorporeal creatures filled my ears as my arrow burst into flames, giving me enough time to aim for another torch. Tatl knew my plan and rushed along the walls, stopping at the nearest sconce. I nodded, she darted away, and I set the wall ablaze. The shadowy mist was swept away by the brightness and more hollow shrieks cried out as the summoned creatures faded into oblivion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl and I set our minds on creating as much light as possible, and following the same method as before, the room was nearly as bright as day except for the middle of the chamber. The dark, billowing mist coalesced together in the center, and Odalwa reformed itself, its body stitching together in a grotesque ballet of twitching muscle and steaming ichor. Moaning in rage, the monster gripped its own flesh with clawed hands and tore chunks of purple, jelly-like matter from its abdomen and arms. The goop pulsed faintly, trailing threads of smoke and a noxious stench as it hurled the globules with savage precision. The sight turned my stomach—it wasn’t just attacking, it was mutilating itself to do so, like some nightmare caught in a loop of endless suffering. I dodged to the side and it missed me by a few feet. Only, as I realized too late, I wasn't the intended target. The torch was now extinguished and covered in toxic sludge, the monster was trying to plunge the area in darkness once more.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link, he's…!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I know I know!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I had to act fast, so I shot arrow after arrow, each one white and brilliant, exploding against the creature. The blasts cracked through the temple chamber like distant thunder, echoing off the stone walls, but Odalwa didn’t flinch. The monster continued its grotesque assault, tearing globs of its own flesh to douse the torchlight, moaning with madness and fury. Each arrow left a scorch mark, a flash of hope—and then despair as the beast shrugged them off.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I grit my teeth and focused my will into the ring on my hand. The next arrow flared orange, a streak of fire erupting from the string—but even as the blaze licked across the monster's grotesque mask, it didn’t slow. The fire singed its hide, but didn’t pierce the curse that kept it standing. The stench of burning rot choked the air, heavy and acidic in my lungs. My heart raced. This wasn’t working.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Something deeper stirred in me. Desperation. Fury. I reached past the fire, past the fear, and willed the bow itself to respond—not just as a weapon, but as an extension of my soul. My grip tightened until my knuckles went white, and the string thrummed with an unnatural tension. I poured my full intent into it: </span>
      <span class="c12 c26 c6 c8">kill this thing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The arrow that formed wasn’t like the others. It shimmered to life in a shaft of radiant, kaleidoscopic light—each hue shifting like breath across water, impossible to name or hold in the mind. It vibrated with a sound I felt more than heard, like a memory just out of reach. Even Tatl gasped, her glow flashing in surprise.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">With a cry that came from the very bottom of my chest, I loosed the shot. The arrow didn’t fly—it </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">sang</span>
      <span class="c2">, tearing through the air like a falling star, and struck Odalwa square in the face. Time seemed to halt. The monster reeled, its limbs contorting wildly, its scream a raw, primal sound that shattered the air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">And then—light.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A blinding, rippling pulse surged outward as the arrow melted through its skull, tearing the darkness apart. The temple shook violently, dust and loose stones cascading from the ceiling, and I was thrown to the ground. For a moment, there was only ringing in my ears, white and absolute.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">And then… something inside me gave.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">It wasn’t pain. It was absence. A soft tearing, like parchment ripped from the spine of an old book. I felt a name vanish from my mind, a detail I couldn’t place—like waking from a dream and knowing you’ve forgotten something precious. Ear-splitting roars made me seize the sides of my head, a pulsing pressure building behind my eyes like my skull was being split in two. I lost my train of thought as I clapped my hands to my head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I curled into a trembling ball on the floor, heart pounding, lungs heaving, every nerve alight with pain and fear. Beside me, Tatl writhed in equal torment, her glow flickering wildly. All I could do was endure, pray the storm would pass, and hold fast to the fragile thread of survival in the chaos. The white-orange flames engulfing the undead terror suddenly turned a sickly green, and erupted up into the ceiling. Then.... silence. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Thick, unnatural, the kind that presses against your eardrums and makes your heartbeat sound deafening. Smoke curled in slow spirals through the air, the only movement in a room otherwise frozen in aftermath. I stayed crouched, trembling, the stench of scorched rot and ash clinging to my lungs while my mind struggled to believe the monster was truly gone. Even Tatl, ever quick to speak, hovered beside me in stunned quiet. Only the distant drip of water and the faint crackle of dying fire reminded me the world was still turning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">My whole head was ringing as I stood up and looked around, the air still hazy with curling smoke and the glow of dying embers casting flickering shadows across the slick, damp stone. A faint chill began to seep  into the ground beneath my boots, making the temple feel more like a tomb than a battlefield won. The stench of burnt moss and scorched rot clung to the air. Nothing remained of Odalwa but that horrific mask, still smoldering where it fell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Seeing Tatl still lying on the cold stone ground, a spike of worry pierced my haze—sharper than any wound I’d taken. For a breathless instant, the thought of losing her, after everything we'd just survived, after the way she'd called me her only friend... it made my chest tighten with something worse than fear. I knelt and gently scooped her into my hands, checking her over for any sign of injury.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey," I said softly. "I... I think it's over. Are you alright?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What? It's over?!" she shouted, a little too loudly, blinking hard. "I can't hear you—my head feels like a scrambled egg!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I winced as the vibration of her voice sent a throb through my temples. "I think we won," I repeated, louder this time. "See?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I pointed to the center of the chamber, where Odalwa’s grotesque mask lay smoking on the baked floor like a discarded nightmare. Heat shimmered around it in waves, and the air above it pulsed faintly with an eerie, ghostly blue hue—as though the mask's spirit still clung to the world, unwilling to vanish.The glow wasn’t steady; it flickered like a dying flame underwater, casting long, distorted shadows against the soot-streaked walls. Faint motes of light—like ash suspended in magic—drifted lazily in the haze, spinning gently in the residual energy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The dim sconces lining the chamber flickered lower in reverence or fear, and the blue light’s reflection danced in pools of stagnant water between cracked tiles, stretching the mask’s warped face into unearthly shapes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">It radiated menace even in defeat, a cursed relic refusing to die quietly. Tatl slowly fluttered up from my palm, wobbling in the air, her face stricken with disbelief.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wait… we actually survived?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Looks like it," I said with a half-laugh, still catching my breath. "I’m honestly amazed we’re still standing."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Right…" she murmured, and her gaze shifted to my arm. "Except that there's a really big gash there. It's bleeding pretty badly! You should probably wrap it up with something."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I glanced down and grimaced at the ugly wound, but shook my head. "I'll be fine. I just… need to breathe some fresh air. Preferably less cursed and rotten."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">She hovered closer, a rare flicker of concern in her glowing light. "You sure? That was… a lot."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah. I’m sure. I've been through worse. Are you alright?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">She hesitated, then gave a nod, her glow dimming slightly. "I think so. My wings feel like they’ve been rung out like laundry… but yeah. Still buzzing."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We stood there for a moment in silence, just listening to the drip of water and our own ragged breathing, each breath scraping up through aching lungs and tasting of ash and metal. The cool dampness of the stone beneath my boots made my bones ache, while the last embers cast weak flickers of orange light that danced across the walls like ghosts retreating from battle. I realized then how deeply I’d come to rely on her voice in the dark. The fight had nearly killed us both.... but here we still were.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What about the Deku Princess?" she asked quietly, breaking the quiet with a gentler tone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh—right! I almost forgot," I muttered. "She’s supposed to be here somewhere, isn’t she?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Supposedly. We should check out that other passage…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl drifted toward the archway leading deeper in, and I lingered behind for a beat, casting one last look at the remains of Odalwa. Then I slumped my shoulders forward and sighed. Every inch of me ached, and more than anything I wanted to leave the foul temple. Still I followed after her, bone-tired and bloodied, but… I had done it. I passed through the fire, and came out victorious. </span>

    <h1 class="c13" id="h.1a4m6e4xyawn">
      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">Corruption's End</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Come on, let's go find that princess!" Tatl repeated as she flew over to the other passageway.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wait, you don't know if there's anything else we should worry about!" I called out, still apprehensive.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We had just defeated Odalwa—the monstrous warden of this corrupted temple, the source of the swamp’s decay. Now only scorched ash and that terrible wooden mask remained, a sickly totem resting in the pile where the beast once stood. I approached it slowly, the heat from the floor still licking at my boots, and stared at its twisted, burned expression. The carved wood was cracked and blackened, yet it still seemed to leer at me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What should we do with this mask, Tatl?" I asked, my voice quieter than I expected—hushed by something reverent or wary.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl fluttered closer, her wings faltering midair before she forced herself forward. “I don’t know, I’m not touching it, that’s for sure. You probably shouldn’t either.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">But before we could decide, the mask pulsed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">A brilliant blue flare exploded from within it, bathing the entire chamber in blinding light. My body stiffened with instinctual dread as I stumbled back, throwing up an arm to shield my eyes. The light wasn’t just bright—it felt </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">aware</span>
      <span class="c2">. Like something vast and watching had suddenly turned its attention to us. I gasped as the ground beneath us seemed to fall away. For one breathless moment, I thought I was being torn from my body.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">When I opened my eyes again, the air was different. Lighter. Clean.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We were no longer in the temple.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Gone was the stench of rot and scorched stone. Tatl and I now stood upon a vast white platform suspended in the sky, surrounded by gently swirling clouds tinged with gold and lavender. A faint wind carried the scent of rain and something older—ozone and memory, maybe. The air here thrummed with silence, but not an empty one. It was sacred.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A strange vertigo swept over me as I walked toward the edge of the platform, peering over the side, and saw nothing but mist and infinite sky. I instinctively stepped back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">“Are we… dead?” Tatl’s voice was small, unsure. “What happened?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">“I’m not sure…” I said, slowly scanning the endless horizon. “I think we were transported. Wait… what’s that? Look there.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A silhouette was rising in the distance—massive, slow-moving, and utterly surreal. Clouds peeled away from it like mist rolling off a mountain peak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">It was massive.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The being loomed above us, emerging from the fog like some forgotten god. Its arms hung long and low, fingers like carved stone. Its body was smooth and vaguely egg-shaped, head and torso one seamless form, reddish skin glinting faintly in the celestial glow. No mouth marked its face, only two deep, dark eyes and a beard-like fringe of green—like moss on ancient bark.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Yet despite its monstrous size and inhuman shape, it radiated a calm gravity. Like the stillness of deep forest waters or the hush of a mountain valley just before dawn. My fear didn’t rise; instead, I felt… humbled. Like I was in the presence of something that remembered the world before it was broken.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">It didn’t speak, but I somehow knew it understood us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Huh...Do you hear that?" Tatl chimed in suddenly, breaking the serenity. "I think it's speaking to us!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I raised a hand to my pointed ear to listen, but all I could hear was a very faint yet solemn melody riding along the gentle winds—something like a lullaby forgotten by time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"It's saying… thank you… for freeing its spirit…?" Tatl said slowly, "And for your sacrifice…. call us…. together again? What does that mean?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I didn't have any time to respond as the bright blue light flashed and surrounded us once more. It didn’t just shine—it wrapped around us like liquid sky, weightless and warm, pulling us up from the pedestal with a force that wasn’t physical but deeply spiritual. My stomach dropped, and a jolt of vertigo seized me as we were transported again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We blinked back into the temple as if from a dream. I swayed slightly, a bit dizzy from the ordeal. A sharp tingling sensation swept through my body—warm, effervescent, like the feeling after waking from a long, dreamless sleep. Then, like sunlight banishing a cold fog, the pain and fatigue of the battle began to melt away. My arm, my legs, my face—all the aches and gashes I’d carried felt like they were gently rewoven, not erased, but lovingly mended. I let out a shaky breath, surprised to find it didn’t hurt. Even the deep, bruising throb in my shoulder had vanished.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl floated beside me, blinking rapidly and then gasping. "Wait… Link, you're—you're healed! I think… me too?" She spun in a slow circle, her wings fluttering more smoothly, her glow brighter than before.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The heavy scent of death was also beginning to recede from the room, like a breath long held finally exhaled. The flickering torches seemed to burn more steadily now, casting golden halos through the mist. Relief bloomed quietly in my chest, and I turned to Tatl, my grin faint but real… tempered by a knowing dread that the battle's echo would linger within the both of us. Her golden light no longer fluttered with panic, but pulsed gently, like a heartbeat remembered. She drifted closer, brushing against my cheek in a fleeting, wordless gesture of comfort. I took a deep breath to steady my legs, still trembling from everything we’d endured, and met her gaze. In that quiet moment, we understood one another without need for words. Our bond had deepened—not through victory, but through survival. Then I remembered the sacred giant...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So…what was that thing?" I inquired and stepped over to her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'm not completely positive," she replied, watching me with a furrowed brow, "but I think that was the Southern Guardian…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"That was a guardian? Geez...I'm glad it was on our side," I muttered, my voice low.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Skull Kid wasn't on theirs though…. and we got banished for it. Anyway, where were we? Oh right, looking for the princess." Tatl began to drift toward the passage again, but her tone had softened. "Come on, let's go slowpoke!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Alright alright, I'm coming. Just let me grab that...mask… Where did it go?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">My eyes searched the center of the room, scanning for Odalwa's mask. The scorched stone beneath where the monster had fallen was still blackened, laced with glowing cracks that pulsed faintly like cooling embers. Wisps of smoke curled lazily upward, twisting through the heavy air. Yet, of the horrific wooden mask, there was no sign—only the lingering impression of magic, like the aftermath of thunder following a great storm. It was as if the mask had never existed, swallowed up by the blue light or spirited away by forces beyond reckoning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I dunno, maybe it was magic or something?" The impatient pixie responded, "Worry about it later, we have a job to do! I'm so ready to be out of this swamp!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I nodded my head and moved on from the chamber, but not before removing the heavy cloak and rolling it up to tie around my waist as an awkwardly thick belt. But I was thankful that the weight was at last lifted from my aching shoulders, and I strode to the corridor. This new passageway we went down was overgrown with foliage creeping up through various cracks and holes. Vines as thick as rope twisted along the floor and walls, glistening faintly with dew. The air felt cooler here, damp and earthy, carrying the scent of moss and decaying wood. Every step squished softly against the moist stone, and occasional drops of water echoed from somewhere deeper within, lending the corridor a hushed, almost peaceful stillness. Although it was dark, a faint light gleamed from somewhere up ahead, making the path a little easier to navigate. As we got closer to the light source, shrill and desperate warbles from what sounded like a deku originated from the area ahead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Finally we had reached the end of the corridor, and a partly opened stone door lay before us. The bright light of torches flickered in the room beyond, and I pushed all of my body weight, as pitiable as I was, against the door. With a loud grinding the door slid open, and the deku began shrieking in terror, which felt like a hundred knives digging into my brain. I hurriedly searched for the deku and found it inside a great wooden cage, huddling in a corner and shuddering with fear. From what I could see, this deku was not a common one. Ornate leaves flowed from its body like a resplendent dress, and it had several pieces of shiny jewelry tied in its long green leaves. I approached the cage slowly trying not to startle the poor creature any more than I already had. It stared at me with frightened glowing eyes and retreated to the back of the cage.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hello?" I spoke softly, trying to ease her fears. "Are you the Deku Princess?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"N-n-no! Leave me alone!" She cried and did her best to curl into a small ball, which was impressively tiny.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"It's alright, I'm not here to hurt you." I reassured, "I'm here to rescue you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The little princess paused for a moment, then gradually unraveled herself. Then she turned around and skipped towards me, but began to panic after getting a better look at her rescuer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You? N-no you must leave this place! You are a female, the monster devours females!" The princess whispered in urgent tones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You mean Odalwa?" Tatl chimed in, "Don't worry about that guy anymore, we beat him!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What?" The deku squeaked in surprise, "You two defeated the ancient terror?! You must be formidable indeed….wait…Where did you get that cloak? Either you are great warriors, or murderous thieves!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No we aren't thieves, your mother sent us to look for you. She thought this hide would help us find you." I explained while working to open the cage. "But your father is gearing up for war I think. Your mother said only finding you would stop him."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh she must be worried off her stump, and my father...oh no!" She hopped nervously, "The one I came to investigate this temple with is the prince of the monkey tribe! He saw me get taken and must have run to my parents for help. Tell me, did you see a monkey there?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"The only monkey we saw inside the palace was bound and being tortured—it was... awful!" Came Tatl's reply, "They think the monkeys kidnapped you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh dear...oh dear! You must take me back immediately!" The princess hopped out of the cage and scurried to the exit. "Well? Come on then!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Sheesh… not even a thank you." My companion muttered, her usual sass laced with a hint of exasperated affection.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I shrugged, but inside, a quiet ache lingered—a cocktail of relief, fatigue, and the strange closeness forged in shared danger. Tatl buzzed nearby, noticeably less brash, glancing at the back of my hand where dried blood still crusted from the earlier fight. Her usual quick wit was absent, replaced by a soft, wordless presence that hovered near my shoulder. For just a moment, her light dimmed to a gentler glow, like a candle flickering in empathy. I turned to look at her, and she met my gaze—something passed between us, unspoken but understood: we had faced death together, and survived. I could feel the bond between us grow tighter in that quiet space, grief and gratitude intertwining. I looked toward the Deku princess, now scurrying ahead with determined urgency, then back to Tatl. Our eyes lingered for one more heartbeat. We didn’t speak. We didn’t need to. And then, together, we left the dark temple, and we didn’t look back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">As we stepped out into the open swamp, the change was immediate and astonishing. The water sparkled, no longer choked with filth but shimmering like new rain. The scent of rot had vanished, replaced by the gentle sweetness of wet bark and blooming lilies. Palm fronds swayed in a warm, forgiving breeze, and distant birds sang like they'd been waiting for this exact moment to return. The very land seemed to exhale, shedding its suffering with every glimmer of renewed life. But the serenity was not complete—far above, the cursed moon still loomed like a cruel reminder. Its terrible gaze staining even this peace.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Still... I let myself breathe the fresh air. Just for a moment, as the princess approached us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh… before we move on, I want to ask your pardon for my rudeness." The tiny princess squeaked apologetically. "I am truly, eternally in your debt, human warrior, and I am ashamed that I didn't even ask your name…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"My name is Link." I responded, and gestured to my partner. "And this is Tatl."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The Deku royal gratefully bowed her head to both of us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"It is my absolute pleasure to meet you both. Now, if you'll forgive my boorish behavior, we really must be off. Please follow me, I fear we have no time to lose!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">She scurried with surprising speed across the bridge, and I took off after her with Tatl trailing behind. We all sped across the remainder of the lizalfos camp and dashed down the mountain like we were mad. We were stopped at the front gates by some very surprised deku guards, who were harshly berated by the princess, but let us all go in without further delay. The inner palace was still filled with incensed deku, but my breath caught in my throat at the horrifying sight of the imprisoned prince dangling by a rope over a bubbling cauldron.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The stifling heat hit me like a wall, and the acrid stench of burning herbs and monkey hair twisted my stomach, making me momentarily dizzy. My breath caught in my throat as my eyes locked onto the grotesque sight before us—an innocent life teetering over a boiling death. Horror and helplessness surged in my chest, paralyzing my limbs even as every instinct screamed to act. Beside me, Tatl gasped, her glow flickering erratically with panic, casting jittery shadows across the floor. I could feel her trembling near my shoulder, and without looking, I knew that her fear matched mine. The king, still at his throne in the back of the room, directed his underlings to lower the monkey into the cauldron while the forlorn queen stood beside him, looking away from the grisly scene. The princess saw the dire situation and shrieked as loud as possible, causing all eyes to turn to her as the room fell silent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What are you fools doing!?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Shaking with rage, she hop-sprinted through the now parting crowd toward the hulking deku king.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Father! How dare you treat this innocent prince so poorly!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wha?" The king sputtered in shock. "Typha? You're-"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">He didn't have a chance to finish as the tiny princess leapt at him and tackled the huge deku to the ground. The queen seemed to be overjoyed, but the crowd of speechless underlings watched partly in awe and mostly fear as the king was stomped upon by his daughter. Once she was finished "scolding" her father, the princess turned to the crowd, who all braced for a similar fate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What are you staring at! Release him at once!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">After a mad scramble, the monkey prince was immediately untied and released. Once he checked over his extremities to ensure he wasn't badly wounded, the prince rushed over to the princess and embraced her warmly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Thank the guardians you're alright, princess! I feared the worst when you didn't come out of that temple with me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"If it wasn't for this brave human warrior and her companion, the worst would have surely happened." The princess spoke somberly and directed everyone's attention to me. "And thanks to them, all the poison that was destroying our home has vanished!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The white-gold monkey hopped over to me and looked me over.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"</span>
      <span class="c6 c8">You</span>
      <span class="c2"> defeated that monster? You don't look... very formidable… but ahh... appearances are deceiving. Not even my best warriors could harm the devil, but...somehow, you managed it! I guess I underestimated human potential…" The prince nodded and reached out to gently touch my hand. "Because of you, our world is saved. From both war and corruption. You will be forever etched into our history as the warrior maiden who brought about our salvation!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh no no! I only wanted to help, that's all." I protested, backing away. "But I'm afraid that I have to get going."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What?!" The trampled king rose up and bellowed. "Not so fast, human! I can't possibly let the heroine who saved my daughter, and the entire swamp no doubt, leave without a reward!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No please, I don't need anything!" I objected and continued to retreat, "But I appreciate the thought..!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The scrubs that surrounded me suddenly burst into cheers, their round eyes wide with admiration. Before I could protest, they lifted me up onto their backs and shoulders, their bark-like arms surprisingly sturdy. I tensed, unsure whether to feel honored or horrified, heart pounding with the sudden surge of attention. As they carried me forward, I caught Tatl’s glance—her wings fluttered uncertainly, mirroring my own unease—as we were paraded toward the towering form of their king. I was set down before the tree-like monarch, who was much larger than I previously thought and stood a good meter or so above me. Having never been rewarded by deku before, I was a bit wary of what was going to happen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Human…" The king knelt down. "If what they say is true, then my kingdom also owes you a great debt. Although, that cloak you're wearing does look familiar...is that..?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I gave it to her, Nuphar!" The queen interjected, "You weren't in your right mind, and I gave all hope to this Link….my faith was not misplaced."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You went behind my back to trust a human, Leersia?" The king gawked at her, then bobbed his leafy head sadly. "You were right to do so….if you hadn't, I would have surely sealed our doom."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"You are too rash at times, Nuphar, but it is all well and good now." Leersia hopped over to me. "I thank you from the bottom of my heart, Link, but, I'm afraid we need that dinolfos hide back. It </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">is </span>
      <span class="c2">a royal treasure after all…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I agreed, and undid the cloak tied around my waist, gratefully handing the hefty hide to the queen. With its weight off my shoulders, I felt a subtle shift within me, shedding not just armor, but a burden of what we had endured in Woodfall. For a second I swore that I could still feel the heat of the battle clinging to the fabric, like an echo too stubborn to fade. In a way, I was happy to be rid of it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Thank you. Now we will return your old cloak, although I decided to have my handmaiden 'improve' upon it in case you returned successfully."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Leersia uttered a few rapid squeaks to her nearby handmaiden, who bowed and scampered down a small, hidden tunnel behind the throne. I exhaled slowly, heart still catching up to the present, and turned to Tatl, whose quiet, steady presence beside me grounded my thoughts.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A few moments later, the servant appeared again, holding my neatly folded cloak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"And what a triumphant return it was," the queen continued, "So I am honored to let you have this small gift in exchange for your noble deeds."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The handmaid skittered over to me and raised the garment toward my hands. I picked it up and immediately noticed something had changed. It wasn't heavier—just smoother, richer somehow. I unfurled it and was pleasantly surprised to see that the inside was lined with iridescent scales similar to the dinolfos skin. And was, thankfully, much lighter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"We lined your coat with our other great treasure. That hide came from a dangerous relative of the armor you borrowed. Although it is not as durable or powerful as its older cousin, those scales have a similar way of blending into the surrounding environment. Please, take it as a symbol of our everlasting gratitude."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I slid my arms through the sleeves and adjusted it, and was very pleased to find that the cloak was hardly a burden at all. The scales inside felt cool and comfortably smooth against my tunic, which was also vast improvement over the older dinolfos hide. Tatl glided around me, gently poking at the draping end of the new cloak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmm, yup! I think this will do." She smiled in satisfaction and landed on my shoulder. "Plus this is much more comfortable for me than that other nasty, thick coat."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I shook Tatl off, who playfully stuck her tongue out and fluttered behind me, and bowed to the king and queen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I realize this gift must be invaluable, and I thank you for your generosity." I stated, then straightened out. "But I must be going now, I'm sure I am needed elsewhere."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ah yes, this world is still in grave danger indeed." King Nuphar somberly bobbed his head in agreement. "But I fear that there is far too much for even you to handle, mighty Link. Reports of the great moon falling from the sky are very unsettling. There are also rumors that every region in Termina is drenched with chaos, especially in the Northern Mountains. Even so, I admit you have much courage to try, especially for a human. You are a true warrior, and we shall memorialize your deeds here!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The throne room scrubs cheered and I cringed internally, hating the attention I was receiving. Yet I smiled out of politeness and swiftly walked away from the reunited family, through the crowded chamber, and out of the throne room. After I was out of sight, I heard the attention of the congregation shift toward the deku princess and monkey prince. Sighing in relief, I strutted out into the courtyard and confidently passed by the many guards, who stood straight and still until I was gone. Once through the main gate, I looked around and breathed deeply of the now fresh, marshy, air. It carried with it the faint trace of moss and damp earth, but also something cleaner—like a sigh of relief from the land itself. For a moment, I let the weight of everything fall away: the battles, the fear, the shadows of the temple. The air filled my lungs with a quiet sense of triumph and clarity, like I had earned this breath, this moment of stillness. Beside me, Tatl hovered without speaking, her glow soft and steady. We both knew the peace wouldn't last, but for now, it was enough.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Dawn was quickly approaching as the few stars I could see faded into the swelling blue of morning. Though the cursed moon still loomed in the sky like an open wound, a serene peacefulness had finally settled over the swamp. The land was healing, and in some way, I felt I was too. There was beauty in the gently swaying ferns and palm trees, the nearby warbles of skittering creatures, and the gurgle of the slow moving river. In that moment, I wasn’t just a warrior or a wanderer—I was someone who had helped bring a corner of the world back to life. And though the road ahead remained uncertain, I carried that restoration with me like a quiet ember burning in my chest. Yet I had to shake myself from my reverie and focus on our next objective. With another deep breath, I turned to my pixie companion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well, I think we're done here. I say it's time to go back to the first day… there isn't much we can do now."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Great… another ride through the time stream." Tatl groaned. "But yup, I guess we have to."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I reached down into my pouch and pulled out the precious blue instrument. Closing my eyes, I pursed my lips around the ocarina and began to play the Song of Time. The notes shimmered in the cool morning air, each one heavy with memory. As the melody reached its end, the strange pull overtook me—like a ripple in water tugging me backward. The world blurred and twisted, the sign of time unraveling like threads from a tapestry. I felt both dread and relief wash over me: dread for all that still lay ahead, and relief for what little peace we had restored. My heart clenched with a quiet fear—what if this was the last time the swamp would breathe easy? What if going back in time also restored Odalwa?? What if... each reset stripped a little more away from who I used to be? Yet there was also hope—fragile, persistent—that maybe, just maybe, I was learning how to carry these burdens despite their weight. Just before everything faded, I caught a glimpse of Tatl’s glow beside me—constant, comforting, like a star guiding me home. Then the light swallowed us whole.</span>

    <h1 class="c13" id="h.6s8mbvhw0ul9">
      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">Blood Dawn</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">It was a beautiful morning in the small, peaceful village of Glendale. The sun was just popping up over the horizon, and early birds were chirping with playful glee as they chased their kin over a crystal clear lake. The blue skies were filled with big, white puffy clouds that were perfect for gazing at, and the town bells were happily welcoming the glorious spring morning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Caros was just an ordinary man, with a serene life as a fisherman who cherished quiet mornings by the lake and the simple joy of watching dragonflies skim across the water's surface. He was also happily married to a beautiful woman with two strapping boys and two lovely daughters. Caros had just finished gathering bait worms from one of the local mud holes and was tying off a sack filled with the slimy creatures, when a loud crack like thunder sounded behind him. The simple man jumped in fear and surprise, slowly turning to see an unnerving sight. A painfully gaunt, masked man wearing blood soaked clothing had appeared from thin air, and was now lying on the ground face up a few meters away from Caros.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Being the decent, kindly fella that he was, Caros rushed over to try to help the strange man.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey mister! Are you alright?" he shouted as he ran.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The masked man didn't answer at first, so Caros frantically checked to see if he was alive and searched for wounds. The man was breathing faintly, but there were gaping, bloody holes in the man's pant legs. Without a word, Caros ripped apart the fabric so that he could get a closer look and try to stop the bleeding. Caros was no healer, but perhaps he could sustain the man's life until the village doctor arrived.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Caros tried to tie off the large wounds, his hands trembling as he fumbled with the fabric. The blood was warm and slick, soaking into his sleeves. One of the legs looked grotesquely broken, the bone possibly snapped beneath the skin. Caros swallowed hard, stomach twisting at the sight. But before he could properly bind the injury, the limb began to contort and snap back into place with a series of sickening, wet crunches. He froze, eyes wide in disbelief as he watched the deep, gaping wounds slowly close themselves. The flesh knitted together with eerie precision, pushing out dirt and old blood like the body was rejecting its own trauma. It was like witnessing time reverse. Caros fell back onto his heels, gasping and pale, struggling to process what he had just watched. In mere moments, all traces of physical trauma were gone and looked as if nothing had happened at all, aside from the bloodied clothing and torn pant legs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Suddenly, the man sat up without a word, startling Caros even more. The horribly wide, yellow-orange eyes of the mask turned to Caros, and a deep, powerful voice resonated from behind the heart-shaped visage.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Where am I?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Y-you're in Glendale, mister!" Caros shakily answered. "I found you lyin' here covered in blood, so I figured I'd try to help a fella out!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I need no help," the voice spoke again. "Not anymore."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Shyeah, you seem to be in fine shape now. My name is Caros, what's yours, friend?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"My name...can I finally recall...?" The man paused, seemingly lost in memory. "Yes. Yes...I know now..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Caros stared, a bit confused at the man's odd behavior, and gestured that he was waiting for the man to finish with a waving motion. The macabre mask began to resonate and became surrounded with a purple glow. The memories, long forgotten, returned in floods....dark...broken....</span>
      <span class="c6 c8">glorious</span>
      <span class="c2">. The eerie eyes suddenly lit up in a fearsome display, like candles within a carved pumpkin, and glared into Caros's widening eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I am called...Majora."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The last thing Caros ever saw again was the masked man raising his hands toward him, a dark flash, and then nothing at all...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Majora stood over the smoldering remains of the foolish villager, his breath slow and deliberate. The acrid scent of charred flesh curled into his nostrils, sharp and satisfying. In this singular act of ruin, there was a bitter joy—a twisted catharsis. The silence that followed the blast echoed louder than screams. For the first time in millennia, Majora felt whole. Seen. Not by kin, not by gods, but by the universe itself—as if the world had paused, watching, remembering. His vengeance had begun, and with it, a terrible sense of purpose. The mask blankly stared as Majora stretched happily toward the sky. Those moronic kinsmen of his, daring to shatter Majora's will! They had feared what they could not control—feared the ancient power Majora had uncovered. His creation, this mask of darkness, was meant to be salvation: the prototype of he called Fused Shadow, forged through dark intent but guided by vision. With it, Majora would have restored their true homeland, the land Hylians arrogantly ruled over in smug laziness. He would have restored the greatness of his people. But they had seen only danger in his brilliance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The True Sheikah—his clan, his blood—had called him mad. Had turned on him. And in the end, they murdered him, and banished the mask into the Shadow Realm. Betrayers! Kinslayers!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The Sheikah Elders would feel his hate! Those traitors would perish in hellfire, again and again and again!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ha!" Majora laughed, raising his hands to the sky. "I'll show them. I'll show everyone how terrible my wrath will be!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The earth began to rumble and dark foreboding clouds began to replace the fluffy white clouds as tendrils of darkness flowed from Majora, whose laughter only grew more sadistic and vicious.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The townspeople of Glendale began to scuttle about in nervous tension as the sky grew ever darker. After fire started to rain from said sky, the people shrieked in abject terror and fled in every direction. They failed to notice one lone, masked figure casually walking into town.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"My vengeance...hahhh... will begin with these pathetic villagers," Majora uttered beneath the mask.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">He snapped his fingers, and suddenly a flaming whip was in his hand. Majora swung the whip at one unlucky villager, who was instantly cleaved in two and burned to cinders. The remains smoldered on the blackening ground as townspeople fled in horror. Majora's terrible laugh and the screeching townspeople could be heard from the farthest corners of the town, as its denizens were consumed in fires as hot as the sun.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Left and right, people were felled by the stranger's malevolent fury. Houses and shops burst into millions of burning splinters. Children vanished in flashes of fire, their laughter silenced in an instant, while women screamed as the heat devoured them like a storm sweeping through dry fields. Death and destruction followed in the stranger's horrendous wake.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">There was no mercy, and no remorse in Majora. For too long had he suffered, for too long had he been helpless, alone, afraid and friendless. He had sacrificed everything for his people! And what did he get in return? Madness! Exile! Loneliness! Suffering!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Now at last, after ages of despair, Majora was not alone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Every! Single! Creature!" Majora screamed in wild vehemence, flailing his whip with each syllable. "They will suffer with me, and know my pain!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Majora did not stop until everything around him was but ash and dusty embers. Then, and only then, did he nod his head in satisfaction, and disappeared into nothingness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">All that remained of the quaint, peace-loving village of Glendale was the wind and dust. Not even the lake survived, and was now a basin of cracked mud full of rotting fish. The skies were forever tainted with the color of blood, as though the heavens themselves bore witness to the horror and could not forget it, stained by the sheer ferocity of the massacre that had just occurred. As a final nail in the coffin, a curse was buried deep within the ground so that nothing would ever grow and flourish again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Such was the wrath of Majora...yet... in the silent aftermath, even Majora's triumph rang hollow. The mask stared out at nothing, and the soul within him felt only the echo of his own desolation.</span>

    </h1>
    <p class="c20 c21">
      <span class="c9 c16 c8 c36">
        <br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The dawn of the first day began as usual. The gleaming sun shone merrily onto the Clock Tower as birds chirped throughout the plaza. The brawny construction crew hammered and sawed, and the early shoppers chatted and hurried into and out of the opening shopping stalls positioned around the area. Yet despite the normalcy of the scene, a faint unease lingered in my chest—a ghost of the horrors from the swamp. I stood beside Tatl, once again at the base of the immense Tower in the middle of Clock Town, wondering about our next move. for restoring peace to Termina.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yep." Tatl shrugged, "Another day, another adventure. What do we do this time?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Shaking a mild dizziness away, I took stock of my belongings by rummaging through my belt pouches and was relieved to find everything still there from the day before, including the new and improved scale-lined cloak. Finding my inventory satisfactory, I looked around and tried to think.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmm...well… didn't we hear someone say something about the north…?" I asked, turning to my companion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl was just about to answer when an inquisitive voice cut into our conversation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey, do you fine ladies need any help?" An earnest young man spoke up beside us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I turned to tell the person that we were just fine when I recognized the intruder—my breath catching just slightly in my throat. There, standing in the morning light, was Ratt. That familiar mop of scraggly black hair, eyes brimming with helpful mischief, a young man of thin, lanky stature, and the familiar blue clothing of a Bomber with the number "3" sewn on the back of a white vest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Something tightened in my chest, an unspoken mix of frustration, unease… and maybe something else. I also remembered the ratty kid's constant flirting. I wasn’t ready to name the feeling yet, but it still lingered like the last note of a song still echoing in my bones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Oh no, </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">not you</span>
      <span class="c2">!" I groaned loudly and put a hand to my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wait, what? Have we met before?" The boy asked in confusion. "I think I would've remembered someone like you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yes...no I mean! We've never met before!" I hurriedly babbled, my mind struggling to come up with an excuse to leave. "I mean I've seen you around, but that's it!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I immediately remembered the small peck on the cheek the boy gave me, and a flicker of vulnerability surged through me, my cheeks flushing red with the memory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6 c8">Idiot, what are you doing?!</span>
      <span class="c2"> I angrily berated myself, mortified at the sudden warmth rushing to my face, struggling to hide the softness I hadn't meant to show.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hehe...ummm… right…" He nervously laughed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Damn it! Too late! I mentally slapped myself, knowing the kid had noticed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uh well, anyway… I just wanted to see if you needed any help since you look a little lost. Maybe I can guide you to wherever you're going?" He quickly changed the subject, sensing my discomfort.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No thanks…" I declined and turned briskly away. "I think we have an idea."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey wait, Link!" Tatl chimed and pulled my hand back as I began walking away. "This guy is one of those Bombers, they'll probably know more about weird stuff happening."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I know what's going on, Tatl, we have to go north!" I argued, yanking my hand away in irritation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"North? As in the mountains?" Ratt warned, rushing to my side. "Ohh no, you don't want to go there, you'd be dead or frozen solid before you could even get to the trails! The Pass is completely blocked with ice, rocks, and snow storms. The only people who can get through are the Gorons. And, if you don't mind my saying so, you're much better looking than a rock creature."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The boy smiled and winked at me, and I rolled my eyes and continued on. A mix of confusion, frustration, and a traitorous flutter of something softer churned quietly beneath my practiced indifference. I quickened my pace away from the youth, heart thudding faster than I liked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Okay okay, I'm sorry!" Ratt apologized and caught up to me. "But you can't be serious about going to the mountains, right? I wasn't joking about that, you wouldn't stand a chance!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"I'll be fine, I've been through far worse I'm sure, including </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">you</span>
      <span class="c2">. Now leave us alone!" I angrily chided, pushing the irksome boy away to get some distance. But even as I shoved him, my fingers lingered a heartbeat too long on his chest—just enough to spark another jolt of unease.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oof!" Ratt grunted, "Sheesh you're stubborn! H-hey wait!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I ignored the boy and pressed on, but Tatl quickly dashed in front of me to block my path.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Stop, you hard-headed goat! Don't you think we should hear him out? Look at where your one track mind has gotten you so far." The fairy flung my hair into my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Why do </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">you</span>
      <span class="c2"> want to listen to this kid?" I fiercely swiped the scarlet locks from my face and glared at Tatl. My voice wavered slightly, the tension building inside me threatening to spill. "Last time he almost got me killed, or worse. He's nothing but trouble!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Last time? What do you mean?" Ratt spoke up from behind. "You keep implying that you know me, but I'm sure we've never met. What's going on, are you on some of that new magic dust? That stuff will kill you, ya know?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We were standing in the middle of the walkway, and I looked around to notice the area was getting crowded with more and more people. With a resigned groan, I pulled Ratt along behind me and into a more secluded and empty storefront across from the tower.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Alright... look, you're going to forget this anyway so I might as well tell you." I sighed and released the boy. "We're trying to save this world, because in three days it's going to end. We can't </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">do</span>
      <span class="c2"> that in three days, so we need to travel back in time constantly. The last time I saw you, you were being beaten by some gang members and I saved your life."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt stared at me for a long moment, his playful grin faltering as uncertainty crept across his face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ya know, I was only kidding about you being on drugs, but... now..uh I think you need to get some help."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I gave him an indignant shove once more, defiant heat flushing through me, and I took out my ocarina.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'm not on anything, you idiot. This is a special instrument that bends time… or something... like that. If I play a specific song on this, I, and whoever I happen to be with, get swept back in time."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt stumbled slightly but kept his eyes fixed on the ocarina, his concern deepening.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You know what? I'm tired of being patronized and treated like garbage by clueless morons," I snapped, my voice shaking slightly, more raw than I'd meant to let show.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt flinched, the mask of confidence crumbling as he took a hesitant step back. The confusion in his eyes gave way to something softer—worry, maybe even regret. And in that flicker, I saw not the flirtatious troublemaker, but a boy who simply didn’t understand the weight I carried.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Don't move. Just sit still." I growled and put the ocarina to my lips.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The notes from the Song of Time swirled around us like golden ribbons in a storm, and Ratt's features contorted from idle amusement to utter disbelief. His jaw slackened, his eyes went wide with terror, and he clutched at the air as the ground vanished beneath us. As we sailed through the endless whiteness of the time stream, his breathing turned rapid and shallow, and he trembled violently, mouthing frantic words I couldn’t hear.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl and I braced ourselves—this was familiar ground—but Ratt crumpled the moment the world slammed back into place, falling to his knees and retching violently onto the cobblestone. I recoiled from the sour stench, watching him struggle to push himself upright, sweat beading across his brow, his lips pale and trembling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wha...what was that?" he rasped, voice thin with disbelief and horror.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"That was time travel." I candidly stated, grimacing and stepping away from the pool of vomit spreading on the ground.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Holy gods…" He put a hand against his forehead while eyeing his surroundings. His breath hitched, and a tremble rolled through his body as he took in the unchanged plaza. Then he gasped, his eyes widening in a blend of awe and confusion. "Wait...gods! A-a-are you a goddess?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl suddenly burst into uproarious laughter and flopped onto my shoulder, trying to speak but unable to do so without laughing. Her wings beat erratically with amusement. I, myself, couldn't help but smile at the ridiculous sentiment, though it felt like a hollow bell tolling in my chest. A goddess. If only he knew how broken I still felt, how even being called a goddess made me feel lesser than I was originally.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No, pretty far from it. But now if you'd excuse me, I have a world to save. Enjoy the rest of your life."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt grabbed my hand before I could leave. I whirled around, reflexively ready to shove him away into the walls of the Clock Tower. But his hand clung to mine—not just in urgency, but in unspoken fear. His eyes were wide, searching, almost childlike in their plea. His grip trembled faintly against mine, and something about his unguarded vulnerability—raw and exposed—made me hesitate. The anger in my chest softened, and my heart stuttered with reluctant empathy, shadowed by a pang of understanding I hadn't wanted to feel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"OK, say I believe you now... but I wasn't joking about the danger in the north. Word is that the land is cursed, frozen into an eternal winter, and that there's nothing left! It's gotten so bad that even Gorons are migrating south, which has never happened before! If you don't believe me, you can ask the Gorons themselves. A bunch are here in town right now!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl, finally recovering from her laughter, breathed in deep breaths to calm herself. Her wings shimmered with a subtle glint of curiosity as she fluttered up from her perch to face me, her expression laced with both amusement and a trace of wary interest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Whewwww… Well, oh goddess? Should we take this kid's advice?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Fine.." I conceded, "We might as well. Where are these Gorons, Ratt?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well I know a few of them are waiting to see the mayor." The lad smiled and held his hand out to me. "I can take you there if you'd like? That is, if you don't mind being around another clueless moron?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Alright…" I sighed in reluctance, and cautiously let him take my hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The tower plaza was gradually filling with eager people as more stalls opened or prepared to open for business. We weaved around the growing crowds toward one of the plaza exits. Ratt pulled me along confidently between buildings and horse-drawn carts loaded with goods. The city was lively and full of sounds. Music from a variety of instruments swirled amongst laughter, bells, and a thousand conversations under a clear blue sky and cheery morning sun. Yet beneath the warmth and joy, I felt a tight, uneasy knot in my stomach—a flicker of anxiety that wouldn’t quite go away. The crowd’s cheer felt almost too perfect, too unaware. I couldn’t shake the sense that this world, so full of life, teetered silently on the brink of ending. If I hadn't known any better, I would never consider that this lively world could be dead in just a few days.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We continued on at a brisk, yet comfortable pace, turning onto a new street with fewer townsfolk traversing the road. The buildings, utilities, and surroundings became more decorative and luxurious as Ratt led us to what I assumed to be Clock Town's wealthier district. Several guards looked our way, expecting trouble, and more than a few of the residents turned up their noses at us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Rich snobs…" Ratt muttered under his breath. "Someday I'll show them…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Show them what?" I raised a curious brow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmm?" Ratt seemed surprised that I heard. "Oh… it's nothing. I just don't like the huge difference in wealth here. These people just hoard everything to themselves, showing off to everyone else how rich they are, and let others less fortunate starve without a thought. My mom would…." His voice dipped slightly, the anger thinning for just a moment. "My mom used to bring me here sometimes... back when she was still around. She always made it feel like the world wasn't so cruel, even here."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">His voice trailed off. I thought I heard a faint quiver in it, but he quickly changed the subject again once he saw me staring.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh...it's...uh...it's nothing, w-we're almost there, don't worry. The mayor's office is just up ahead, just don't cause any trouble since the guards here are the worst. I've been kicked and pushed around by them plenty of times in this part of town."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">He quickly shook his head and forced a laugh, trying to cover the slip. "Anyway, let's just keep moving. No need to dwell on the past, right?""</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Why? Do </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">you</span>
      <span class="c2"> cause trouble? Maybe you go around flirting with their wives?" I said with forced levity, though the edge in my tone betrayed a deeper frustration I hadn't intended to show. The words slipped out sharper than I meant.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No, they just don't like the Bombers. See, I technically don't have a home...or uh... money. That's how most of us Bombers are. Jim, our leader, is the mayor's son. His mother absolutely hates this club though, probably since the rest of us are poor and all. She...kinda believes we're no better than a murderous, thieving bunch of criminals…actually that's what she believes all poor folks are like."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt spoke in cold, angry tones, lost in thought, and I felt his grip slowly tense around my fingers—a pressure that caught me off guard. There was a quiet intensity in the way our hands remained joined, and something in that touch stirred a warmth I wasn’t ready to name. A flicker of guilt, of tenderness, maybe even attraction—it all twisted together, leaving me breathless with confusion.. A quiet pang of sympathy bloomed in my chest—his anger wasn't aimless, it was shaped by pain, by a life of being overlooked. I found myself squeezing his hand back, just slightly, unsure if I meant to comfort him or anchor myself in the midst of his rising frustration. He then quickly snapped back to the conversation and relaxed his hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"But Jim, he scorned his mother's hatred of the lower class. Even though he himself is just a kid, he saw us street urchins as equals and decided to help out by giving us all food and stuff. One day he comes down to our hideaway, all alone, and asks us if we want justice. Pretty much everyone, having lost everything to the upper class, says yes. He then brings us these fancy blue clothes and says that we're apart of an underground crew that fights for justice and good. See, he got his father to somehow sign a doctrine that makes our crew an official 'secret society of justice forever'… or something like that. The guards absolutely resent us for that, and think of us as nothing more than a joke…."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">As if on cue, I ducked as I heard a small stone whizzing through the air and narrowly miss the boy's head. I turned to see two guards in gleaming silver armor laughing raucously as the stone loudly clattered off into an alleyway. I furiously pulled my hand free of Ratt's and made my way to the guffawing soldiers in burning rage with Tatl following suit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Hey! Did you just throw a </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">rock at us!?</span>
      <span class="c2">" I shouted out, feeling an inner rage boil over.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No, don't!" Ratt quickly wrapped around my arm and pulled me away. "You'll only get us in more trouble than it's worth!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The guards saw this and laughed even harder, nearly coming to tears.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wahahaha! Better listen to your weasel boyfriend!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hahaha, yeah! You don't want any of this!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Let me go!" I furiously wriggled to get out of Ratt's surprisingly strong grip. "I can take them all on!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I...urgh...bet you can!" The boy struggled to keep hold of me. "But there's….ugh...more of them than us!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"N-no! I'm… going to teach.. them a...gah!" I gritted through my teeth, unable to wrench free.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Please...stop...whew…. I'm o-only trying to help!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link, he's right, there's more of them coming!" Tatl beseeched, fluttering in front of me. "Remember we're trying to save them, not hurt them?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">By now I had managed to be pulled some distance away from the two chuckle clucks who were sauntering off, and finally ceased my attempts to pull away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Why should we let them get away with that?" I glowered at Tatl. "Those bullies don't deserve to be saved!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Look…" Ratt spoke softly as he loosened my arm. "As much as I want to fight them, violence won't solve this problem. If we fight, we'll be seen as the villains, and then we'll be imprisoned or…..executed. It's not fair, and it's not right, but it's what has to be done for now. It's how we survive."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I turned to look him in the eyes to protest, expecting to see nothing but defeated weakness, like the hollow gazes of others I'd met who'd borne too much pain for too long. But instead, I saw something else entirely. I saw a fierce, indomitable determination in his sea-green gaze, a reflection of something I’d nearly forgotten in myself.... It reminded me of my own first taste of destiny, the moment I stopped being a child and chose to become a hero, all those years ago when I witnessed the death of the Deku Tree, and I saw my reflection in a pool I mourned at in losing my only father figure...with a blazing determination in my eyes that would never be smothered, a fire that refused to die, even when the world tried so hard to drown it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhh...right..." Ratt coughed as if to clear his throat, shattering through my reverie. "Maybe, uh, we should get going before more guards harass us."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Good idea." I shook myself back to the moment, refocusing on our objective. "Lead the way."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I let Ratt get a little distance before following after him, trying to gather my thoughts. Tatl dropped down onto my right shoulder and moved in close to my ear.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey, what was that all about? Are you feeling OK?" She muttered quietly, a note of sharpness in her voice that wasn't quite concern.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'm...not sure. I feel like I know him…" I whispered, catching the faintest glimmer of suspicion in Tatl’s eyes. She hovered just a little closer, her wings fluttering in front of me, as if to put distance between me and Ratt. Her gaze lingered on him a moment too long, shaded with something like jealousy, or maybe just fear of being left behind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well, you did save his life last time. So you do kinda know him." The pixie shrugged, "Maybe all this time travel is going to your head?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmmm… yeah you're probably right... Let's just keep moving okay?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Sure sure, whatever you say."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">With a final inquisitive glance at me, Tatl rose into the air again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Just up ahead, Ratt had stopped in front of a large building resplendent in banners hanging from a marble balcony, colorful masks in all shapes and sizes, and various statuettes. Two soldiers in gold-trimmed white armor stood guard at the heavy wooden door, glaring suspiciously at the three of us but thankfully staying put.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So...Link is it? This is the place, I'm uh...sorry you had to deal with that back there. That's just how the west side is... but the Gorons should be in there."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Thanks, Ratt." I smiled, nodding my appreciation. "I guess I'll see you around then."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah, maybe." The boy grinned, and headed toward an alleyway across the street.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I stepped up to the door, pausing in case the two decorated guards decided to confront me, and went inside when neither moved. The large wooden door was fairly easy to push open, likely the hinges on every door were well greased in this part of town, and walked into a large lobby with green flooring, comfortable-looking couches in the corners, and an impressive model of the entire town taking up the center of the lobby. A glossy, dark red desk took up the far end of the room with hefty doors on either side of it. A mousey, green-haired secretary sat at the desk, silently shuffling papers and letters into separate piles. She hadn't noticed me yet, so I stepped up to the desk and asked about the Gorons. Without looking up from her piles, she politely answered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"The Goron visitors and their emissary are in an important meeting right now with the mayor. I'm afraid you'll just have to wait until the meeting is finished."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We both jumped as something in the other room crashed onto the floor with a resounding boom, followed closely by the loud exclamations of what seemed to be furious arguments.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ummm, maybe it's best if you wait outside?" The secretary nervously stated.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"That sounds like a great idea." I replied in agreement, remembering just how strong Gorons were.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Just as I reached the entrance, something big and heavy flew through the now destroyed door on the left side of the desk. It crashed into the wall with a groan, which turned out to be a crumpled soldier. A hulking Goron angrily stomped out of the ruined doorway and was trailed by two other, smaller Gorons. I expeditiously moved out of their way as they trudged out the main door. Two guards rushed out of the room to check on their comrade and a smallish figure peeked out from the demolished door. The man seemed extremely high strung, and had deep, dark circles beneath his maroon-colored eyes. His thinning blue hair was drawn back into strange, horn like shapes and he wore dark, officious clothing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ohhh dear… what else could possibly go wrong…?" He sighed in exhaustion and put a defeated hand upon his head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Mr. Mayor? What happened in there?" The secretary cried out.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ohhh…. just Gorons being Gorons. I wouldn't worry too much, I have a feeling they'll be leaving soon….I hope." He mumbled that last part to himself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Seeing my opportunity to catch the Gorons, I dashed out the door in pursuit. Thankfully they didn't get very far, and I rushed before them and confronted the apparent leader, who halted and peered down at me in confusion. Townsfolk rushed to get away from the strange, potentially dangerous sight, and the cowardly guards kept eyes on us from a distance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What do you want, tiny human? Come to gawk at us like the others?" The massive Goron, who was easily three times my size, questioned.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I've heard you had some trouble up north, brothers!" I tried to sound as aggressive and intimidating as I could in my effeminate voice, though a flicker of self-consciousness tugged at me—an awkward reminder of the strange dissonance I still felt inside my shifted form. "I want to help!" I declared, but the words trembled slightly in the air, caught between defiance and something deeper. A mix of desperation and conviction burned behind my eyes. This was more than bravado. It was a plea to matter, to fight back against helplessness. It was always my destiny....to take on burdens no one else could, to rise when others fell, even when I wasn’t sure who I truly was.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c20">
      <span class="c2">
        <br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The Gorons were silent, likely contemplating if I was insane or joking, but the leader finally spoke up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Tiny Human, not even our fiercest warrior could save our home. He was mighty indeed, and take no offense, but you are not even half his size…" The mountainous creature mused. "I must thank you for your kind gesture though. It was the first offer we received in this wretched city."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I understand, brother. But I can assure you that I am capable! Surely there must be a way I can prove this?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmmmmmmm…." The Goron grumbled in deep thought. "You speak like our own kind, have you... dealt with us before?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yes, as a matter of fact, in my homeland I was made a Sworn Brother." I replied, as confidently as I could manage.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"...You? Are a Sworn Brother?" They all seemed surprised, and the leader spoke up again. " Either you are a deplorable liar, or our knowledge of humans is sadly defunct. Are you not a…hmm what do they call it...mother human?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No...I mean- yes...ugh. Look, things are different where I'm from, I was accepted as part of the Goron family for saving their land."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"How odd… Very well, we actually have a more immediate problem you can help with. Solve it, and you will have proven yourself."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No problem, brother. Tell me what you need?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmmmm…." The Goron spoke a bit uncertainly, "The human chief here refused to help us. It is fortunate you offered to help though, one of our young was stolen from us last night as we rested from our long journey. We know it was a group of humans and followed them here, but we are now lost and frustrated in this horrid city."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'm very sorry that such an evil crime was committed by my kind. I shall do my best to right this wrong, and bring your child back, or die trying!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Good, I pray you find him, kind, er...brother." The Goron leader nodded his satisfaction. "The child is critical to our future survival, especially if Snowhead is truly lost to us. You have been entrusted with a great burden, tiny human—may your courage carry you through. We shall be outside the northern walls of this awful city, away from this toxic air. Find us there, should you save our young."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">With that, the Gorons all tromped off toward the northern park, parting the small stream of timid people like boulders in a river. I decided to go find Ratt once more, who seemed to be my best chance at finding this lost Goron kid. I turned to ask Tatl her opinion, only to discover that Ratt had been standing beside her for who knows how long.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Heh, Sworn Brother, eh?" Ratt teased, his eyes glinting with mischief as a crooked grin tugged at his lips. He rocked back on his heels slightly, arms crossing with playful confidence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah...um.. How long were you eavesdropping there?" I asked in slight annoyance, walking over to them both.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Pretty much the entire time, you're pretty brave for blocking off an angry Goron like that. I was simply standing right here as...I dunno...back up? Someone had to pull you outta the way in case they decided to keep going."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I have a feeling I'd be the one saving you… again," I retorted with a teasing smirk, catching the faintest blush flicker across Ratt's face before he looked away, suddenly fascinated by the ground.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Anyway, I guess you spared me the inconvenience of tracking you down. I assume you heard about this lost Goron. Do you have any idea where this kid is?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Nope…" Ratt shook his head. "But I think I know who to ask. That is, if you want my help."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Hmm…." I put a finger on my chin, pretending to weigh my options. "On one hand, you </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">are</span>
      <span class="c2"> pretty annoying. But on the other, you seem to know what you're doing… Yeah, I guess you can help this time."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh come on already!" Tatl loudly interjected, flying in between us. "Get a room, you two, or let's get going! We're wasting daylight!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Right. Sorry… enough playing around." I agreed, embarrassed at my own immaturity. "Where do we go, Ratt?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well, the Goron said that their kid was stolen by a group of humans, right? I know a place where stolen things have a tendency to turn up. I have to warn you though, it's not exactly the safest place in town…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I highly doubt it'll be more dangerous than I am," I replied, but the words felt strange in my mouth—like I was borrowing someone else's voice. A flicker of doubt passed through me, quickly buried beneath my usual bravado.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yep, we can handle anything you throw at us. You have no idea what we've been through." Tatl nodded, adding her own input.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You know, strangely enough I believe you." Ratt conceded, suddenly smiling with enthusiasm. "I gotta say, you two have definitely made my life more exciting!"</span>

    </p>
    <h1 class="c13" id="h.vsd00zsrvv0e">
      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">The Wild Side</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The sun had reached its apex by the time we left the lavish neighborhoods of west Clock Town, and the soothing coolness of the morning had been replaced by a humid heat. Although the terrifying moon had reappeared in the sky, looking almost as big as its heavenly counterpart, no one seemed to notice or care. The cobblestone streets crowded with townsfolk and tourists only seemed to increase the muggy temperature to a sweltering oven. Still, the sounds of merriment from various street performers, banter of happy, excited visitors, and shouts of vendors hawking their wares filled the air. Horse drawn carts full of cargo and people took up the center of the wide road, making the trek feel even more claustrophobic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt did his best to work out a way around the crowds as he pulled me along. The horde jostled us both every which way, and I felt like I was within a herd of cattle. Eventually, Ratt pulled me into a shaded alley that was mostly devoid of pedestrians and released my hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Whew, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't realize the streets would be so crowded today." He spoke, peering out to the bustling road. "At this rate it'll be getting dark by the time we reach the south side…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Is there any other way? Surely you must know a shortcut or something?" Tatl chimed, flying in close to his face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Well...I dunno if it's a shortcut exactly, but this alley leads to a street that normally has little traffic. It's along the unofficial border between Midtown and Southside." He contemplated, scratching his sparse chin hair. "The only problem is, it's also an unofficial toll road for the Blood Wolves…. one of the </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">worst </span>
      <span class="c2">gangs in town."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt's face suddenly held a dark, somber expression as he blankly stared at the brick wall beside him. Something about the way his shoulders slumped, the distant look in his eyes unsettled me. I felt a flicker of unease, a quiet warning whispering at the edge of my thoughts. What ghosts was he seeing in that wall? And why did his silence make the air feel heavier?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Soooo we weigh out the better options." I reasoned out, breaking the heavy silence, "On one hand, we have a street overrun with people and carts, which is essentially a roadblock at this point. On the other, there's a relatively clear path, supposedly, but there's a risk of a fight. I think it's pretty obvious in my opinion."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah," Tatl twinkled in agreement. "Let's avoid all these rude tourists and take the easy road!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well...alright then, if you guys say so." Ratt stated and looked at my bow. "Maybe that might come in handy, just in case we do find some Blood Wolves."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I simply nodded, knowing the power of the weapon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"By the way, I don't think I know your fairy's name? I'm kinda mad at myself for not asking sooner, ya know?" Ratt rubbed the back of his neck, apologetically peering at Tatl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"His...er...I mean, her fairy!? I'm my own entity, kid!" Tatl rebuked and forcefully poked Ratt's nose. "Nobody owns me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"OK OK, my mistake!" He raised his arms to defend himself, turning to me. "This one certainly has more spirit than all the other fairies I've talked to!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You have no idea…" I agreed emphatically, "Tatl can be a huge handful. And I mean that in a very… endearing way."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Me a handful?" Tatl turned her onslaught towards me. "You're the one who always gets into trouble, and I always have to come save you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I...hmm… Yeah I guess you have me there." I nodded, then felt a smug grin cross my face. "So no worries, Ratt. If we do run into these Blood Wolves, Tatl here will rescue us!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ha ha, you're so funny." Tatl rolled her tiny eyes. "You know your bow can take out any idiot who wants to take us on, no need for me to waste my energy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hehe and if nothing else, you can scare them off with that mask." Our guide stepped closer, pointing to my belt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Huh?" I glanced down to see a big portion of my mask exposed. "Oh… this, um… is just... an ordinary mask I found, that's all."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I quickly adjusted its placement to hide it fully under my cloak. Ratt just smiled and shook his head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Eh, I don't think anything about you is ordinary, haha!" The boy laughed, shrugging his shoulders. "But fine, keep your secrets. In any case, we should get going don't cha think?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yes, lead on." I muttered, eager to get off the subject.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt nodded, ran to the other end of the alley, and peered around the corner, motioning for us to follow him. Tatl and I filed behind him and we were off.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The high walls of the surrounding buildings brought gracious relief from the sun. Although littered with rotting garbage in more than a few areas, the path was easy to navigate, much easier than the crowded streets anyway. Ratt wasted no time getting through the corridors, but noticeably became more and more uneasy the further we got. Finally, he stopped at the exit of a fairly dilapidated alleyway, and peeked into the street.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"OK, so this is the border. We gotta be careful here, these guys do not like the bombers… and particularly me, so it'd be best to not run into them." Ratt uttered quietly. "And I </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">really</span>
      <span class="c2"> don't want them to find you... So just stick close to the walls, ok?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl and I both gestured in affirmation, and we all quickly turned onto the street, hugging close to the nearest homes and empty, boarded-up shops. Our guide constantly glanced around, worry was written all over his features. He suddenly veered off across the roadway toward a dark corridor and we dashed after him. Once Ratt made sure we were still with him, he ducked into the shadows. We prepared to follow, but the boy was suddenly launched back out to the street by some unseen force.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Ratt landed on the hard pavement with a loud </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">'Ooof'</span>
      <span class="c2"> rolling a couple times before coming to a painful stop. I tried rushing over to help him up, but a bulky, tattooed man intercepted me, separating us. Two other men shuffled out behind the first, followed by a shorter one with a disfigured face covered in scars.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well well well… look who it is!" The scarred man sneered. "If it isn't our old pal, Rattie? Ooooo and he brought a pretty little pet with him, too!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt choked out desperately for me to run, but was cut short by one of the men kicking him in the stomach. The burly brute reached out to grab me, but I was too quick and nimbly leapt back. Without a word, I had my bow drawn and a fiery bolt nocked and pointed at the apparent leader.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Let him go, or I shoot!" I ordered in a commanding tone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What's this? A kitty with claws, eh?" The grotesque leader mocked, not taking my threat seriously. "Whatcha gonna do, yer outnumbered princess!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmm, good question!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I replied, turning to the man standing over Ratt, and loosed the bolt at his leg, my heartbeat thudding in my ears. Rage flared through me—hot, instinctual, protective—but beneath it simmered a cold calculation. I couldn’t let them hurt him. Not again. Not anyone else. The assailant crashed to the ground a few feet away from the boy, screaming in agony as the flaming projectile exploded and shredded his leg to smoldering pieces. All three of the remaining gangsters stood there in fear with mouths wide, while their comrade shrieked, writhing on the ground clutching at what was left of his leg.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Now let us pass," I growled menacingly, "Or next time I'll shoot to kill."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Alright alright!" The leader pleaded, holding his hands up in surrender. "We'll get our man and leave you be, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">He ordered the remaining two brutes to pick up the whimpering mess and they began to retreat down the street.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"But remember!" The scarred man shouted back at us before disappearing around a corner. "This isn't over, princess! You don't know who yer dealing with!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I scowled at the retreating cowards, and ran over to help Ratt up to his feet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Urggh…" He groaned, "I'm definitely going to feel that tomorrow…. I thought we were done for."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"They weren't the worst I've dealt with. Just common thugs. Are you alright? Is anything broken?" I asked, looking him over.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Y-yeah I'll be fine, but….you... that was incredible! How did you even do that?" Ratt stared in awe at my gleaming bow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh, yeah...this is a magic bow. The Great Fairy gave it to me as a thank you for saving her." I explained, re-slinging the weapon onto my back. "By this point it's saved my life countless times."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Gee… I bet!" He grinned foolishly before wincing at the pain in his stomach. "You really are something, you know that? I mean, I can only </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">wish </span>
      <span class="c2">to be as courageous as you!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No, I don't think you do." I sadly disagreed, walking toward the shadowed alley. "It usually just gets me into more trouble than it helps anyone. It's….a curse."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Psshh, I don't think it's a curse. I think courage like yours is more valuable than any treasure. If half the people in town were like you, these gangs wouldn't even exist!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I looked around to face Ratt, expecting to find a sarcastic smirk on his face. But instead, what I saw caught me off guard—his eyes were steady, almost reverent, filled with an admiration that made my stomach twist. Something warm flickered in my chest, unfamiliar and uninvited. I didn't know whether to meet his gaze or look away. Part of me wanted to push it down, bury it deep—but another part, the quieter one, simply ached to understand it. I stood there in confusion until Tatl flew into my face, blocking my view of Ratt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hellooooo, can we get going now?" The fairy berated impatiently, "Remember our mission? Baby Goron? Geez it's like I'm dealing with children!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yes...yes you're absolutely right, Tatl." I narrowed my eyes...blaming Ratt for stirring up these distracting feelings, and waved the boy ahead of me. "Lead the way, before we run into more trouble."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhhm....r-right. Sure. No problem." Ratt answered and took point, but not before a rueful look flashed across his features. "It's not that far now."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Good." Came my tart reply.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Despite a restless Tatl buzzing around my head, I let Ratt get a few paces ahead before following. My feet moved automatically, but my chest felt tight, as if carrying a weight I didn’t yet see. The memory of his eyes lingered, and I hated how it made my thoughts tangle. Why was this bothering me so much? Why couldn’t I just brush it off like usual? I was more irritated with myself than anything, this kid was going to get me killed if I couldn't concentrate on the task at hand. Why was I so distracted in the first place? The idea angered me even further and I let out an audible '</span>
      <span class="c6 c8">huff' </span>
      <span class="c6">of irritation</span>
      <span class="c12 c26 c6 c8">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What's going on with you?" Tatl softly interrupted my thoughts and landed on my shoulder. "We can ditch this guy if he makes you so upset. I'm sure we can easily figure things out without him."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No...ugh…..maybe...I dunno." I put a hand to my face in exasperation. "I have no idea what's going on. We should have just left him at the Clock Tower."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wellll… it's not too late. Just play your ocarina."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No...no I'm tired of starting everything over….Let's just get this over with and find out how to climb the mountains... I'm sure I'll be fine if I can just get out of town."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Alright, but I'll be keeping an eye on you. You've been acting pretty weird ever since the deku palace in the swamp."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Tatl, there's nothing wrong with me." I grumbled in annoyance. "Just calm down and stop worrying about me, got it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Fine, sheesh!" She indignantly leapt back into the air. "I was only trying to help, Princess Prissy-!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"-Hey, uhm… is everything all good back there?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt's voice interrupted, and I saw that had stopped before a wooden crate at the end of the alley.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yes, we're fine. Just....peachy." I mumbled as I closed the gap to the crate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Heheh...OK then…" The boy laughed nervously, and then a sigh left his mouth. "Uh…hey whatever I said back there, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset y-."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Don't... just…. don't." I cut Ratt short, holding up a hand to silence him. "Let's keep focused here. How long until we get to wherever we're going?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Not far…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Great, after you then."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">One look at Ratt's face made it clear that he was hurt, but I turned away, pretending to not care as he headed out of the alleyway. A pang of guilt tugged at me for being so harsh on him, but I pushed it aside, telling myself he'd recover. The world was teetering on the edge, and I couldn’t afford to stumble over a boy’s wounded feelings... even if something in me wished I could. This world needed to be saved, and I really needed to be free of this damned curse, so one kid's feelings didn't matter compared to everything else. I couldn't afford to be preoccupied by Ratt's emotions. Still... he really was a brave kid. I shook my head and decided to study my surroundings, to concentrate on something else.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">It was evening, and the sun drew ever closer to the horizon. Long shadows stretched from lantern posts and ramshackle rooftops. We were walking once again through dilapidated Southtown, but were in a different neighborhood I hadn't seen before. The streets, if you could call them streets, were more of muddy, rutted smears than they were roads. Garbage and waste were strewn everywhere, making the assault on all of my senses that much more potent. Many people here were armed in some way, brandishing weapons from crude batons to rusted swords. More than a few gave us cursory glances, as if they were deciding whether or not to rob us blind. Most chose to pass us by and ignore us, but one or two drifted in close with greedy eyes. I went for my bow in an attempt to warn them away, but it was only when Ratt called out to the potential thieves that 'we were with him' did they leave.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">There was something in his voice—smooth but sharp, like a grin wrapped in velvet. It wasn’t loud, but it </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">cut</span>
      <span class="c2"> through the tension like a drawn blade. The way he held his posture, relaxed but not careless, gave the impression that he was someone used to surviving in rough company—and maybe even being liked for it. He radiated a kind of streetwise confidence that I hadn’t noticed before, like he was someone who had learned how to command a room without needing to raise his voice. Strange, to be sure, but I chalked it up to Ratt likely being one of them. Still, a flicker of doubt stirred in me—was he truly one of them, or just someone who had learned to survive among wolves? There was a thin line between trust and caution, and I wasn’t yet sure which side he walked. Maybe there was a certain comradery with poor people?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">In any case, it seemed we were soon approaching what I assumed to be our destination. A crowd of destitute beggars were cloying at each other to get into one of the larger, more sophisticated dwellings along the path. Inconspicuous, unmarked wagons and austere horses were secured to various posts on the sides of the windowless two-story building. There was smoke pouring out from two of its chimneys, carrying with it the mouth-watering scent of roasting meat. Yet aside from everything else, the surface of the shack was rather bare and stark in appearance. I lost my train of thought as Ratt suddenly turned a corner at the edge of one of the huts before the lively house, waving at us to follow him quickly, and ducked behind the back wall.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So...this is it." Ratt muttered when we joined him behind the hut. "Once we get in, it's probably best that you let me do the talking. If I find out where the Goron is, I'll tell you so you can finally be rid of me ...and I won't bother you ever again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">He started heading to the back of the bigger shack, his face devoid of any emotion. I sighed mentally, my thoughts caught between frustration and something softer. A strange flicker of guilt—or was it fear of losing whatever fragile connection we’d begun to build—tightened in my chest. Before Ratt could take another step, I reached out and placed a hand on his shoulder to stop him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ok ok...Look...I… I'm sorry." I said gently, unable to rid myself of sympathy for his obvious sadness. "I didn't mean to treat you so harshly. You are just trying to be helpful, and I'm…well… not used to…. being like this. My life in this world has been, umm… let's just say different. Either way, you don't deserve to be spoken to as poorly as I did earlier."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ya know…" Ratt paused, then turned around to look me in the eye. "I wasn't sure at first, but I knew there was a warm heart in there somewhere. I just had to draw it out of hiding, hehe!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The boy winked, cracking a wide smile which I couldn't help but share. But then his face took on a more somber expression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"In all seriousness though, thank you for...uh, apologizing I guess. I can't imagine that it'd be easy to open up for someone like you. I have no idea what you've been through, but it sounds horrible. So, I appreciate it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I didn’t know what to say to that. His sincerity unsettled me more than his teasing ever had. I felt the warmth of his words curling around something tender inside me—something I hadn’t realized I’d hidden.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oookay, this touchy feely stuff is great and all!" Tatl huffed and hovered between us. "But don't we have a thing to do here?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah yeah, Tatl, we're going!" I shooed the pixie away from my face. "I just needed to say my piece, to ease any tension."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Pfft...right. I know exactly what's going on." She groused to herself, then scowled at the boy. "Hmph! Whatever. As soon as we're done here and out of this city, we can get on with our other, extremely important mission! Which doesn't include dumb, helpless children like you!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl viciously poked at Ratt again before flitting behind me, uttering foul expletives under her breath. Her wings flickered more sharply than usual, and she buzzed close to my ear with the kind of energy she only got when something really bothered her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhhhh, what's going on?" Ratt asked, clearly sharing my confusion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Nothing! Get going, bomber boy! We're wasting time." Tatl responded before I could.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I simply shrugged, and Ratt shook his head before heading in the direction of the shack. Tatl remained silent, probably for the best.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We ended up going to the back of the shack, where there was a plain, whitewashed door guarded by two well-armed guards clad in thick armor who stood with the posture of skilled warriors. Ratt asked me to wait and walked up to the door, whispering something to the intense guards that were both at least two feet taller than him. One bent down, nodding gruffly before opening the door, and Ratt waved us over.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Both peered down at me in suspicion as I passed, almost daring me to make a false move, but remained at ease like grim, unwavering pillars until we were inside. The interior of the shack was much different from the unremarkable exterior. We had entered at the back of a large, busy kitchen judging from the ovens, cauldrons, and counters full of food. There were two hallways on either side leading out from the kitchen, and were neatly lined with luxurious, decorative rugs. A plump woman wearing an apron barked orders to scrawny, malnourished men as they scrambled to fulfill those demands. Slender young ladies, with heavily made up faces and dressed in opulent kimonos, quietly scuttled into and out of the kitchen. They laboriously hauled bottles of liquor, jugs of wine, dirty dishes, and heaping trays of food down the left corridor, where cacophonous sounds of laughter and obnoxious fighting resonated through the building.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">No one gave us a second glance, being so busy, and Ratt pulled me away, guiding us down the other hallway. Most of the servants ignored us and shuffled by without a glance, with the exception of the hefty overseer, who only eyed us with mild curiosity.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"OK, so this place can be very dangerous. It'd be best to stay quiet, this guy pretty much owns everyone in here, and I definitely know he would try to employ you if given the chance…" Ratt said in hushed tones. "But he's the best chance we've got at finding this Goron."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Slaves?" I whispered harshly, the idea seeming barbaric. "How does he get away with that?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Shhhh!" Ratt shushed with a finger to his lips. "They aren't slaves, just servants. Most of them chose this life and get paid with food and shelter... And, trust me, this is much better than the life of actual slaves."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I was a little shocked, wondering who could ever choose this living. I kept thinking of the word Ratt wouldn’t say—'slaves'—as I watched the girls glide past with their painted masks and tired eyes. They looked too young to have chosen anything.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I looked back at Tatl, who hovered right behind me and seemed to be troubled about something, until she caught me checking on her. She immediately glared at me, her wings giving an irritated flutter, and turned away with a sharp huff—her glow dimming slightly like a candle flickering in protest. There was a wounded pride in the way she moved, and something close to jealousy etched into the curl of her flight. I rolled my eyes, knowing she would let me know what her problem was sooner or later, and focused on Ratt. He had stopped a couple feet before a gilded door protected by a tall, lean man wearing leather armor, and motioned me to stop.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The man guarding the door wore an eye-patch over his left eye, with a deep scar trailing down to his chin beneath it. He had jagged features and a thin, lumpy nose that revealed it'd been broken many times over. His good eye was dark, holding a fierce malice within, and it bore down on Ratt as the boy approached.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I need to talk to Mutoh." Ratt stated.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The guard cracked his leatherbound knuckles, then fingered the daggers sheathed on his hip. After a tense moment, he grunted, then pounded on the door. Seconds later, a muffled voice sounded from the room beyond.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What did I tell you about disturbing the master? Do your job, you idiot, and stop bothering us!" chided the faint, raspy voice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The man only furrowed his brow and hammered the door harder. Only then did the door crack open from within and the frail, withered face of an old man thrust out from the gap.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I swear to the gods that if you bang on this door again…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The elder threatened in a voice that sounded like a dead tree creaking in the wind. His frame, hunched and draped in dark, tattered robes, gave the impression of fragility... but there was something unsettling in the way he moved, coiled and precise, like a retired predator who still remembered how to kill. Scars traced his hollow cheeks, and his knotted fingers clenched the doorframe with surprising strength. When he saw Ratt, his crinkled eyes narrowed and his thin lips twisted into an evil sneer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Why, if it isn't the little Ratt!" the old man hissed. "What do you want, come to beg for my forgiveness?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Our quarrel was settled, Grisane, and you know it," Ratt replied decisively. "I need to talk to Mutoh."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Take care with your tone, boy. You may be a favorite around here, but I've killed for far... far less...-" the gnarled elder warned, but was suddenly interrupted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Grisane! Who's making all that racket out there?" a deep, boisterous voice called from within the room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ughhh… this isn't over, pondslime…" Grisane spat at Ratt before turning to answer. "It's Ratt, m'lord! Shall I order him to leave?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Nonsense! Let the boy enter, you old fool!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Grisane opened the door a bit wider, and the sinister-looking guard stepped to the side. We began walking toward the door when Grisane held up a withered hand to halt us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Only you, runt. Your little friend can't come in," he smoldered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt nodded to me, said he'd be OK in the room, and went inside with the door slamming shut behind him. The doorman shifted back to his original position, watching me with his one eye. He made no other expression aside from a frigid intensity, and made no effort at conversation. I decided against talking to Tatl, who was still sulking beside me. Saying the wrong thing in this place could get us all killed anyway. So, I simply studied the elegant hallway to pass the time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">It really wasn't a horrible looking place, and likely rivaled even the mayor's residence. The soft, white carpets underfoot were spot-free, and had patterns of red and blue diamonds going down the center of the hall. Silver wall sconces, complete with gleaming sapphires for bottom decorations, neatly lined the walls and provided a cheery amount of light despite the lack of windows. Pictures, arranged evenly between the lit sconces, presented finely dressed people standing with somber expressions in dark rooms. Seeing nothing else of interest, I leaned up against the wall and waited for Ratt to eventually come out. My thoughts wandered in the silence. I found myself caught between suspicion and the faint pull of trust. Who was he really? A scrappy survivor, or something more? The stillness of the hallway offered no answers, only the sound of the guard’s quiet breathing and the slow, uncertain beating of my heart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link, I don't like this place," Tatl finally whispered, drifting up to my shoulder. "Why would that kid bring us here? I mean, for all we know he could be trying to sell us to these crooks!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"He wouldn't do that, at least... I don't think he would. But if they do try to enslave us, I won't hesitate to do everything I can to get out," I said, patting my mask on my hip.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Hmmph… right. If you still </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">can</span>
      <span class="c2"> use that anymore…" she mumbled in irritation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What's that supposed to—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Thankfully, we were interrupted by the door cracking open just enough to let Ratt out. His demeanor seemed troubled, but he sidestepped the guard and walked over to me with a small smile.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So, good news," he informed me as we walked down the fancy hall. "The Goron kid was apparently kidnapped by a thief named Sakon. He sold the poor kid to one of Mutoh's thrift shop owners on the east side of town. Mutoh said we're free to take him back to the Gorons—he doesn't want a war with 'em."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Huh... I guess that </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">is</span>
      <span class="c2"> pretty good news. But, umm… what's the deal with you and these people? You don't seem like the sort of person to go along with… this kind of thing." I gestured to the painted-up servants rushing about.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uh, well… I'd rather not get into it," Ratt grimaced. "You have your secrets, and I have mine."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">There was something in his voice—an old wound dressed with a fresh smile. It wasn’t deflection so much as survival, the kind of softness someone carries like armor. For a brief moment, the facade slipped, and I glimpsed the boy behind the masked smile: someone who had once been powerless, and who had learned to become charming just to stay alive. I didn’t press further.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Okay, fair enough."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I chose to change the topic to something less controversial as we exited the mysterious building. The sun was long gone and stars glimmered overhead, and I could see Tatl was worn out and practically sleep flying. I held back a yawn, beginning to feel drowsy myself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So... I think we're all getting pretty tired here. What do you say we find a place to turn in for the night?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yes, that's exactly what I was about to ask you two, hehe!" Ratt chuckled, stifling a yawn. There was something charming about the way he still tried to keep things light, even after what had likely been a draining encounter. "But definitely not anywhere near Southside. I usually sleep at the club hideout, but no one would allow me to even talk to you about it… uhh… like I just...heh... did."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh...right. Those stupid club games... I already know about it. I've been there, too. Living in a sewer is nothing impressive… no offense."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wait… really?" Ratt sputtered in disbelief. "How did you even find it? How did you get past the boys? How did Jim not even find out about it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Trust me, that's a story you don't want to hear." I groaned. "Anyway, I'm sure you'll want to go back to your hideout. I think we'll go sleep in the park."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well… at least let me escort you there. Even though you could probably handle anything that wanted to mug you," he added with a grin that was half-joking, half-worried. His voice softened slightly. "Still. I'd feel better seeing you safe."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Fine, we'll follow you to the north park, but then you'll have to go somewhere else," I stated, uncomfortable with the idea of him staying with us. Yet, even as I said it, a part of me felt reluctant to send him away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah, we can take care of ourselves!" Tatl spoke up, suddenly more awake, a little sharper than necessary. Her wings flared slightly, and she positioned herself between me and Ratt—subtle, but unmistakably protective.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhh sure? That's no problem, hehe… Let's hurry on up then so you both can get some rest," Ratt said, still smiling, though a faint shadow passed behind his eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We all walked in brisk, yet tired silence the rest of the way. Most of the paths were clear of beggars, but there were more than enough quickly moving shadows to keep me on edge. I was grateful that we were swiftly out of the Southside district, passing through Midtown and the empty shopping district with ease. Ratt occasionally glanced over his shoulder, as if checking for danger—or perhaps checking on me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Eventually, we reached the northern park around midnight. Tatl was already asleep on my shoulder, her light dim and her breath slow. I told Ratt that we'd be fine as I headed for a tree.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Alright, don't worry about finding me in the morning, I'll catch up with you." He yawned before gently patting my hand, his touch light but lingering—just enough to stir something warm and uncertain in my chest. I wasn’t sure if it was comfort, gratitude, or something else entirely, but I held onto the feeling as he turned to go. He hesitated, like he might say something more, but only smiled instead. "Get some sleep… Link."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">As he walked away, disappearing into the dark, I watched him go longer than I meant to. Tatl stirred slightly, her tiny body curling closer to me in sleep. I sluggishly clambered up the nearest fully grown tree, trying to shake the strange ache in my chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Once on a large branch that was sturdy enough for my satisfaction, I curled up along it with my back firmly against the trunk. Tatl gave one final murmur and drifted again into slumber. I closed my eyes, but the memory of Ratt’s hand on mine lingered longer than I wanted to admit. Eventually, sleep took me too, quiet and heavy, drawing me into the hush of the stars.</span>

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I once again found myself back in Hyrule, but dark clouds filled the sky over the fertile green lands. The grass and trees of the field swayed as damp gusts of wind blew in from the north. I looked northward to Hyrule Castle, at those familiar towers and ramparts looming high, and narrowed my eyes as I saw lightning flashing all around it. Something was wrong. I whistled loudly over the rising wind for Epona, and listened for her whinny. No response. Something was very wrong, and I immediately began to sprint toward the castle, fearing the worst. Thunder boomed in the distance and rain began to pour down. Suddenly, a bright flash of lightning split the ground before me into a crumbling chasm between me and the castle's direction, effectively blocking my advance. I slid to a halt and witnessed a huge version of that sinister Majora's Mask rise from the newly formed rift. I rolled back away from the edge, drawing my sword in the process. The mask began to pulsate strangely, contorting and twisting like a living thing. Then, with a wet, sickening crunch not unlike the sound of bones breaking, it began sprouting gangly, maroon arms and legs with brightly colored tattoos covering them. A demonic head, covered in its own set of tribal tattoos, boiled up like a wart rising from the top of the mask, complete with pointed horns, sharp fangs, and a single, leering green eye filled with wrathful hate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">With an inhuman roar, the ghastly entity shot long, sinewy whips from its arms. The lengths cracked towards me, and I leapt to the side, attempting to bring my sword down to sever the whips. I swung, but my strike came up empty as my sword had suddenly disappeared! I had no time to realize where my sword went as the tendrils slapped into me and knocked me to the ground. Winded, I shakily got to my feet to get some distance, but to no avail. The muscle-like lengths wrapped around my legs and drew me closer to the edge of the cliff as I squirmed and wriggled to get away. The terrible orange and emerald eyes of the mask body lit up like flames the closer I got to it. Unarmed and helpless, the binding whips squeezed and coiled around my entire body like a serpent readying to devour its prey, until only my head was free. The mask creature cackled with sinister animosity as it dipped beneath the trench walls, pulling me into the depths with it. As I fell into the chasm, the last image I saw was the demonic face grinning fiendishly, and then darkness...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I gasped and my eyes shot open. I quickly sat up in fear, flailing my arms to fight free of the whip-like appendages, only to knock my head on an overhanging tree branch and wake Tatl in the process.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Whoa what the-! Link what's wrong?" The fairy panicked as she instinctively took flight.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I clasped both hands to my head to rub the pain away, hissing and clenching my teeth. Along with the unwelcome headache, my clothes were damp with either cold sweat or morning dew, and I was shivering from the chill in the pre-dawn air. The cold bit deep, mingling with the lingering terror in my chest. The mask's eerie laughter echoed in my mind, and I could almost feel the phantom coils still wrapped around my limbs. I exhaled sharply to steady myself. Needless to say, I was grumpy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Urghh...nothing Tatl… Just a bad dream!" I growled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Geez, you have those a lot don't you?" Tatl ignored my irritable response and fluttered closer in concern. "Hmmm. Looks like you hit your head pretty hard there. Are you ok? Lemme see it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No I'm fine. Just a bump…" I muttered and waved the fairy away, massaging the slowly forming knot. "Sorry for waking you up though. You can go back to sleep if you want."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Nope, I'm awake now. Besides, it looks like rain... again. I doubt we'd have slept for much longer before it tried to drown us..." The fairy chimed glumly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Looking around from our perch in the tree, I saw the threatening rain clouds Tatl mentioned looming above. Judging by the moist, earthy scent in the air, a heavy downpour would be happening soon. I searched for Ratt to see if he was nearby—the sooner we could be off, the better. But there was no sign of him nor anyone else.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Hmph… I thought to myself. That mischievous boy must be hiding somewhere, probably right around the corner as usual.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well...I guess let's find Ratt. He's probably not too far off," I stated aloud. "Hopefully he'll take us right to the Goron and we'll be long gone by the time the rain really comes down."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh gods I hope so…" Tatl muttered, already sounding annoyed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Without another word I skillfully hopped down the tree, using the branches as stairs, and waited for Tatl to catch up before I started toward the dirt path. I only assumed Ratt would just pop up from some bush, or from behind some tree, but after a few minutes of walking around, Tatl and I both began to lose our patience. Tatl's movement grew more erratic, her wings buzzed faster, and she zipped in agitated loops around my head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Sheesh! Where is that brat?" Tatl's high voice finally echoed in the empty park, sharper than before, her glow pulsing with irritation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"That's a very good question. He did say he'd catch up with us. I wonder if he said something about meeting somewhere else?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Pfft. He should've been more specific, we don't have time for these stupid games!" The fairy plunked down onto my shoulder. "I mean, we have a world to save and all. Besides, he's already on my chit list."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Your chit list?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah, my chit list. Like, a list of people that I have problems with. For each problem I give them a chit, like a mental… yeah, whatever, you get the idea."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Umm yeah I guess. But why him? What did he do?" I asked in amused curiosity.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh like you don't know, pfft."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl joked, but after seeing my confused stare her smile faded. With a furrow of her brow she skipped off my shoulder and hovered in front of my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wait, you don't? Do you even know how you've been acting these past few days? How you act when he's around?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I haven't been acting like anything, what are you getting at?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Seriously? Every time that kid shows up you can't take your eyes off him and act like a lovestruck pony!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No I don't!" I protested, stopping to focus on my friend's luminous form. "I only stared at him because he moved so quickly, I didn't want to get lost in those alleys! And I'm not in any way acting like a lovestruck pony."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl floated closer to my face, her wings fluttering in short, irritated bursts as she narrowed her eyes with suspicious worry. There was a charged flicker behind her gaze—not just concern, but something closer to jealousy or protectiveness, like she was bracing herself for something she didn’t want to admit. She opened her mouth with an accusatory glint in her eyes, when a large raindrop pelted her in the face, halting her response and causing her to drop. I caught her in my hand and dashed toward one of the tunnel-like passages out of the park into the main districts to get out of the now steadily falling rain. Once in the tunnel, I swiped the wet strands of scarlet hair out of my face to check on Tatl, who was coughing and sputtering something about the dumb sky falling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey, hey...are you hurt?" I lifted her to eye level.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Pbbth, stupid...*cough cough*...water! You try being the size of a human finger and get slapped with a giant, speeding ball of water!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I can't imagine it being fun, I guess today just isn't our day. We've both had our hard knocks, hmm?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Both? I'm the one who's suffering here. I've got to deal nearly drowning on top of being the only one with a brain while keeping clueless, ungrateful children out of trouble!" Tatl hissed and stomped on my palm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhhh…. did I interrupt something?" Came a familiar voice behind us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I jerked my head around to see Ratt standing awkwardly at the end of the tunnel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh! Umm...no we're just having a normal conversation...kind of!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I quickly dropped my hand and shuffled around to face him, momentarily forgetting about Tatl and accidentally dropping her. A twinkle of surprise followed by an angry tirade of mumbled rants buzzed from the pixie, and I quickly apologized, trying to help her off the wet ground. Understandably, she kicked my hand and launched from the ground in a huff.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Heheh, uhh...right." Ratt laughed nervously and walked over to us. "So, I thought you might be hungry and brought us some breakfast. Although… I'm sad to say that I don't know what fairies eat sooo… I'm sorry Tatl."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt pulled two apples from a nearly empty sack he was carrying, his movements a touch slower than usual. Dark circles beneath his eyes hinted at exhaustion, and the way he shifted his weight—favoring one leg—suggested lingering aches from their recent ordeals. After slinging the worn sack over his back, he offered a sheepish grin, as though trying to mask the toll the past day had taken on him. My stomach immediately began to growl, I'd forgotten that I had hardly eaten anything for days.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Oh you don't know?" Tatl said in honeyed sarcasm, "Why, we fairies only eat sunshine, laughter and happiness!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt continued to grin, but unease was clear in his gaze. He reached an apple toward me and I all but snatched it from his hand. I gave Tatl a look of fierce disapproval and began to wolf down the fruit without a second thought.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Omigosh tharnk yoo!" I graciously thanked Ratt with a mouthful, then turned to scorn my rude friend. "Cormorn Tatl, eaze op! He merns well!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt ate his own apple patiently, making a face like he was trying to hold back a laugh, and eventually released a chuckle as he watched me devour my apple.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hehe, wow! You must've been hungry!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmm?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I looked down at the apple to see it was already down to the core, its sticky sweetness still lingering on my lips. The sudden realization stirred a small wave of discomfort—part embarrassment, part something else I couldn't name. Not just from the hunger sated, but from the quiet truth that I'd let myself go without food for far too long. Worse still, I’d devoured it like an animal, right in front of Ratt. My face flushed hotly with shame... not only from being seen so unguarded, but because some part of me cared how he saw me. That thought alone made my throat tighten. I quickly wiped the sugary residue off my chin, pretending to be composed, even as my heart twisted with awkward self-awareness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh yeah...well, umm...I haven't really eaten in three days. I've been…kinda busy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl, who had grown steadily more tense with each moment, abruptly channeled her frustration into a sharp, stinging kick to my ear. Her wings buzzed angrily as she darted upward again, her movements short and jagged—more than just annoyance, there was real anger simmering beneath her reactions, something that felt personal and unresolved. I clasped an empty hand over it and shouted in pain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Owwwch! What the…! Why'd you do that?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl merely stuck out her tongue and retreated upwards from my irritable swatting. I caressed my ear tenderly and groaned in frustration.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6 c8">Cursed, goddess-forsaken fairies</span>
      <span class="c2">… I mumbled inwardly and continued eating the last bits of the apple.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uh...are you ok there? Has your…friend... been doing that all morning?" Ratt asked, noticing the bump on my forehead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Yes, I mean, well… not my head, that was my own fault." I said as I swiftly gulped the rest of the apple down and dropped the core. "But she </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">has been acting strange lately…well stranger</span>
      <span class="c2">. Aiee!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I yelped out again as Tatl roughly yanked my ponytail, and I angrily lashed out at her, hoping I'd connect with my fist and knock some sense into the rogue fairy. The precocious pixie rose up into the air again, but must've forgotten that my extreme agility gave me a higher jumping advantage. My strike probably would've hit if it hadn't been for Ratt catching my other arm to pull me away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Woah woah! What's going on between you guys? You were like best friends yesterday morning, now you two are fighting like cats?" The boy interjected and stepped between us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We were all silent for a moment. The short tunnel was filled only with the sounds of rain and distant thunder. Ratt still held onto my arm in case I decided to go for Tatl, while his free hand was poised to block the fairy from getting to me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I have no idea why! Let me go!" I exclaimed and tried to tear my arm away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"That's right, you have no idea. Which is why I'm staying here! Just go without me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Fine!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I stomped a foot in frustration, then swiftly proceeded down the tunnel, away from the park and into the rain, dragging Ratt along with me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey hey, c-calm down!" Ratt pleaded over the rain, barely managing to hold onto my arm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"No, she…! I...</span>
      <span class="c6 c8">uurrghhh</span>
      <span class="c2">!" I stopped walking, but I was far too angry to communicate or care about the pouring rain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ok, uhhh….let me take you to the Goron kid real quick I guess... Maybe then you two will be calm enough to-"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt suddenly crumpled to the wet cement pathway when a large rock glanced off the top of his head. I had no time to react as heavy ropes looped over my shoulders to tie around my waist and legs, binding my hands and feet and preventing me from getting to my bow. At least five people, all dressed in shoddy clothing, burst forth from behind trees and buildings with the sudden, chaotic energy of a trap being sprung. The air filled with the slap of rain against their worn boots and the sharp hiss of rope being thrown, and my pulse spiked with a rush of panic—there was no time to react, no warning, only instinct and dread. the ropes around me were pulled tight and my left shoulder painfully crashed to the ground beside Ratt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Get off me you barbarian</span>
      <span class="c6 c8">mrrhh mmhh!</span>
      <span class="c2">" I cried out, but a filthy rag that tasted of dirt, sweat, and blood was stuffed into and tied over my mouth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Quick, get 'er bow!" Ordered one of the bald, hulking brutes with facial hair, standing at the top of the tunnel wall. "And search 'er good! I don't want no surprises!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I squirmed and kicked as best I could manage, yet my bow was ripped off my back as another set of hands roughly rummaged through my belt satchels. Panic clawed up my throat as I twisted my head to see a squinty-eyed, wiry man with missing teeth and oily, thinning hair pull out my Ocarina and masks. Seeing those sacred items—the core of so many battles, so much identity—tossed aside like worthless trinkets sparked something bitter and helpless in my chest. He sneered at the priceless treasures, letting them clatter to the wet earth with a cruel smirk, then caught me looking. That glance, that moment—stripped, bound, and powerless—made something sink cold and deep into my stomach.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ahhh wot a pretty lil' catch you are, eh? Hmhmhmhm!" He laughed through his bulbous nose and drew closer, squinting his eyes even more as his grin widened.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I coiled back from the rotten stench of his breath, then reeled as his scarred, rough hand partially opened my cloak and slid from my neck down the front of my body, stopping at my chest....</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oy, Squam! Get yer damned grubs out o' there, you mangy dog!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The bulky, brown-bearded man at the top of the wall leapt down, easily landing on his feet, and kicked the man off of me with black, heavy leather boots. I silently thanked the gods.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You know she's for the boss, you diseased stalchild!" The leader bellowed as he beat the thin, stringy underling. "If you so much as lay a single digit on 'is prize again, I'll kill ya and feed ya to the sharks!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The rest of the group were transfixed on the violent beating, and I noticed Ratt was still out cold, lying amidst the puddles rippling in the rain. I strained against the ropes in an attempt to loosen them as I looked around, but it was no use. I reluctantly ceased my struggle, deciding instead to look around and try to formulate a plan. Now that the sun was coming up, I could see there were now seven soaked, disheveled, yet menacing cutthroats around us. The man, who I assumed to be the ringleader, continued to blast the disgusting bandit with a flurry of kicks. Finally, after ensuring that the vile man named Squam was properly subdued, the leader barked orders to the others.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Right. Anyone else wanna piece? No? Then let's move quick, eh? The guards'll be over here soon. Derzo, pick the rat up! I'll take the mouse here."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">One of the more muscle bound vagabonds, wearing an open tan vest and baggy gray pants, stepped over to Ratt and plucked him up off the ground like a toy and threw the unconscious youth over his shoulder. The leader, just as big as Derzo, picked me up with similar treatment. I caught a glimpse back through the tunnel to see if Tatl had seen any of this, but there was no sign of the fairy. The last things I saw before a black blindfold covered my eyes were two other gangsters grabbing my things and the entire squad ducking into an alley.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I rode, thoroughly soaked, for what felt like hours, my limp body jostled on a hard shoulder with every step as freezing rain needled into my skin. My arms ached from the tight restraints, my cheeks were raw from the blindfold’s chafing, and each breath carried the sharp sting of cold. Beneath the numbness, a gnawing sense of dread clawed at my chest, every bounce a reminder of how powerless I’d become. Judging from the amount of pungent, rotten smells of the trip, our captors mostly stuck to empty alleyways. Eventually, ages later, I heard the creaking of an old wooden door on rusty hinges, the stomping of numerous heavy boots on a wood floor, followed by drunken laughter and brawls coming from a further room. More bumps and shifts on the shoulder, the sounds of dogs barking and howling, more stomping on hard floors, then finally I heard metal grinding on metal and a few loud clangs. I was none too gently slung around like a ragdoll and dropped on a hard, cold floor. What sounded like a wet sack of potatoes hitting the pavement landed next to me, and my blindfold was finally removed. I shut my eyes against the onslaught of bright torchlight, then squinted to see that we were in some kind of crude dungeon that could've been a wine cellar at some point. The lead kidnapper and Derzo stood high above us, and Ratt shifted a bit, starting to regain conciousness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Chain the rat up, Derz. He's coming to, looks like." The leader pointed, then looked into my eyes. "Now then, little mouse. I'm ordered not to harm any pretty lil' hair on yer head. But if you even </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">think</span>
      <span class="c2"> about escapin' I'll make ya pay dearly fer it, we glassy clear?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I bobbed my head in affirmation, shivering from the cold, and he undid the gag over my mouth. Derzo had finished chaining Ratt to the wall with rusty manacles clicking shut. My mouth felt as dry as the Gerudo Desert and my clothes clung to me with a clammy chill, like I'd been dragged to the bottom of Lake Hylia and left to freeze. The sensation made my skin crawl—not just from the cold, but from the sharp ache of helplessness gnawing at my pride. I was stripped of everything that gave me power, soaked, silenced, and stared at like prey. The humiliation of it all settled in my stomach like a stone. Even so, having a bone dry mouth didn't stop me from trying to spit in the man's face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ha! Lukhan is gonna like ya, that's for true." The man hooted in mocking laughter, then nodded to Ratt. "Though, can't say the same for your boyfriend there, he's been stealing from us fer years now. Cost us many a good slave, that rat. The boss has somethin' special for 'im. Say yer g'byes while you can, lil' mouse, cuz you won't be seeing 'im again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">With a final chortle, the two exited the cellar. Derzo slammed the metal barrel door shut and stood guard on the other side with his huge arms crossed. Ratt stirred and mumbled something, and I turned my attention on him to ensure he was alright. Finally his eyes snapped open, and he glanced in fear at his surroundings until his eyes caught mine.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link! Oh by the guardians, I'm sorry! I didn't know they…!" He frantically apologized as tears came to his eyes. "I'm so so sorry!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hold on, calm down! Let's just think here, what are they planning to do with us? Why'd they ambush us? And who are these people?" I interrogated as calmly as I could, though still shivering and trying not to chatter my teeth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well… if I'm right, but I seriously hope I'm wrong, we're in the Blood Wolves hideout. Remember those guys we ran into yesterday, they were Blood Wolves? I am kinda….probably on their list of people they really want dead." Ratt explained hurriedly, and pulled on the manacles. "These guys are slavers, part of the pirate operation down at the ocean. They take tourists and visitors to Clock Town and ship them south using the sewer system. I've helped free dozens of people, so I'm not....erm...popular with them. They'll kill me, but if they have you too then that means...well…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">His voice trailed off and I urged him to continue.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well what? What's going to happen?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Well you're a very...uhh… lovely girl. They'll probably… keep you as a concubine to share between the high-ranked members. I know it's horrible, but I overheard them say something about it once...passing attractive women around like trophies to share between the high ranked members. So you </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">have to get out of here!</span>
      <span class="c2">"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What?!" I immediately felt sick to my stomach. "Gods...I hope you have a plan here!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Shh shhhhh!" Ratt hushed, nodding toward Derzo. " Keep it down. I'll think of something… of course if you have any ideas I'm open to just about anything right now."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"I-I don't know… I've never really been in a situation like this. Well… there was </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">one</span>
      <span class="c2">. But that was a long time ago, and I was way better equipped." I muttered nervously, recalling my adventures at Gerudo Fortress.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhh, right. Well… don't be scared ok? I'll figure this out… and I'm sorry again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'm not scared!" I hissed, "I'm just freezing, if only we had a fire in here…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I longingly wished for the warmth of a roaring campfire, and how I could easily make one with the bow and…</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c12 c26 c6 c8">Wait...my ring?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I curled my hands, trying to feel for the ring. My right index finger quickly found the cool metal of the ring on my left middle finger, and I instantly perked up, ecstatic that I found a possible way to escape!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey, I think I might've found a way out of here!" I whispered excitedly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Really?" Ratt inched over as close as he could. "How? What's the plan?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well...I have a magic ring that causes my bow to shoot fire. If I could use it to burn these ropes off, I could maybe undo those manacles, and we could escape! My clothes are soaked enough that I doubt I'll get burnt."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ok...? I have so many questions, but I really don't care right now. How do you plan to get past the guards?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I..umm...hmm. I've got nothing for that. If we could get to my mask though, it'll be a piece of cake."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uh, your mask? What are you gonna do, scare them?" Ratt raised a brow in confusion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ha, you'll see!" I chuckled quietly, "Once I put on the mask you'll understand everyth-"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Suddenly the jail door opened and we both jumped as the bearded leader walked in with his heavy boots thumping.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Good news, little mousey! You're coming to see Lukhan right now. Lucky you, eh? Haha!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I tried protesting, but was once again plucked off the ground and slung over tough, lumpy shoulders. My body jolted with every step the brute took, the ropes still biting into my arms. As I passed by Ratt, his eyes locked with mine—wide, stricken, and glassy with unspoken fear. There was a kind of desperation there that made my breath catch. He wasn’t worried about himself. It was me. That panic, so raw and directed only at my safety, left me reeling. Part of me wanted to cry, to call out and reassure him I’d be alright—but another part recoiled, uncertain if that gaze came from love or dread. And I didn’t know which would scare me more.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The jail door slammed shut behind us, the final echo sealing that chamber like a tomb. Derzo’s massive frame filled the doorway once again, and I was hauled up a creaking staircase into a hall of warped, rotting floorboards. The air was thick with mold and the sour tang of spilled ale. Drunken shouts, fists pounding tables, and the occasional shriek of laughter bled in from the next room. A poorly-tuned piano clanged out broken chords in a stubborn attempt to inject levity into a place that reeked of misery.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hear that, mousey? You'll be hearin' it a bunch more, so ya best get used to it haha!" The burly kidnapper laughed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I struggled to remain cool-headed the further we went, until we stopped at the end of a rickety hall. I was set down and faced towards a set of black double doors with a large symbol of a skull with inlaid rubies for its eyes wrapped in chains, carrying a dagger in its grinning mouth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Alright. I'm gonna untie you now, but no funny business, eh? Here's what yer gonna do, yer gonna step inside this door, yer gonna cooperate fully with whatever the boss tells ya, or we're gonna chop ya up and feed ya to the pups, yeah?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I nodded silently.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Good." He undid the knots on the bindings, opened one of the doors and gently pushed me inside. "Now be a good girl and no trouble, eh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">And with that the door gently shut behind me, leaving me in a sizable room full of animal trophies and pelts. The room was brightly lit by three chandeliers, each holding about a dozen candles and made up of the gilded bones of various animals. Ranged weapons of all sorts hung along the walls, crossbows, bows, spears, and a strange weapon with a hollow, trumpet-like end, with the other being flat and solid. The floors were also carpeted with the furs of bears, wolves, wildcats, and foxes. On the room's right sat a gaudy, opulent bed with colorful pillows, and four tall posts that held sheer white curtains which hung below the red and gold blankets. The left side had a long dining table strewn with half-eaten fruit and smoked meat, with several wooden chairs laying in disarray. I turned to the far end of the chamber, seeing a large chair laden in furs and decorated with animal horns and bones protruding from the top and sides. I inhaled an excited breath of air when, to my surprise, I saw all of my missing items laying in the seat of the chair!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I eagerly snuck toward the throne, heart pounding with hope, but immediately halted as a strange scent—burned oil and animal musk—curled into my nostrils. It was wrong. Unnatural. A faint draft whispered across the back of my neck, threading through my damp clothes like the breath of something ancient and watching. Then came a low, creaking groan.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A hidden seam behind the throne split open like a wound, and a figure emerged from the shadows.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I froze, my lungs tightening as if the very air had turned to stone. My pulse thundered against my skull. Torchlight flickered over the figure’s olive-toned skin and unruly mane of red-orange hair—each step forward sent new ice lancing through my spine. Then his eyes met mine. Piercing. Dangerous. My knees nearly buckled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">It couldn’t be....</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">No. It couldn't. Not here. Not in </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">this</span>
      <span class="c2"> world.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The man standing before me was the image of a nightmare I thought I’d buried. The same cruel calm. The same terrible power coiled just beneath his skin. The same eyes I remembered facing when I stood between him and the kingdom I'd nearly died to protect.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ganondorf..." I whispered, though I wasn’t even sure my lips had moved.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">But I knew it couldn’t be him. This wasn’t Hyrule. This was Termina. And yet—every part of me trembled with memory, with dread, with the helpless instinct to run.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Whoever this was... whatever he was...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I knew this malice well...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">And I had just walked into the lion’s den.</span>

      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">A New Threat</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c24 c20">
      <span class="c32 c9 c16 c8">
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I could do nothing but close my eyes and brace myself, my body tense with dread and fatigue. My soaked clothes clung to me like ice, and the cold had long since crept into my bones. My thoughts spiraled—every second stretching into eternity—as I envisioned blades, branding irons, or cruel hands. I tried to still my trembling, but my breath came in shallow gasps, and my heartbeat thundered against my ribs like a war drum. For a moment, I thought I heard footsteps approach, and my stomach clenched painfully. I was completely vulnerable, and the weight of that helplessness threatened to crush me as surely as any weapon ever could. I waited for a few seconds then, shocked that I still drew breath, I opened my eyes to focus on the man across the room. He did nothing but observe me in turn. Upon closer inspection, the Gerudo man standing at the other end of the windowless room was not who I initially thought. Ganondorf was long gone and likely wouldn't return for another age at least.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">This man was much younger, likely in his twenties, not much older than me, with a thinner face bearing a neatly trimmed goatee that shimmered faintly in the torchlight. He wore his reddish-orange hair similar to his goatee, braided back along the sides of his head, with the same colors of beads interlocking the twists. His outfit included a long, black trench coat with red serpentine dragons snaking up the sleeves, beginning at the wrists. Large gold buttons kept the coat closed up to his sternum, which revealed only olive skin beneath it. At his sides were twin scimitars with jeweled ruby and emerald hilts, fastened to an ornate golden belt by thick, black leather loops. For a moment, the blades appeared only decorative at first, but upon at a second glance I knew the weapons had seen much use. He seemed to be wearing the same type of loose, baggy pants I'd seen other Gerudo wear, but they were jet black instead of creamy white. His boots, reaching mid-shin, were gilded at the toes and tops, and red dragon patterns similar to his sleeves were embroidered along the heel and calves.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So, you are the little fox who severed my crewman's leg yesterday." Lukhan finally spoke, his voice a silky tenor laced with amusement and threat, like honey over a blade. "I must say, you aren’t what I was expecting. When they described you, I imagined some drunken harlequin fumbling through town. My men do not often flee from clowns, you see. They usually eat them for breakfast."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">He approached my gear laid out on the chair like a collection of trophies, running his fingers over them with the familiarity of a man used to taking what he wants. His smile never reached his eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmm...a colorful, radiant instrument. Charming. Two masks: one for a warrior, another for a humble deku scrub. A tragedy or a comedy, I wonder? Or perhaps both, depending on who's holding the stage."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Lukhan chuckled to himself, lightly tossing the masks back as if they were no more than toys. Then, reverently, he lifted my glowing bow. The admiration in his gaze sharpened into something colder—possessive.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Now this... this is exceptional. I have held hundreds of weapons in my time. Bows gilded in the finest gold dust from the Goron Mines, spears taken from the master craftsmen of the Zora, axes built of metals mightier than a Grand Dodongo! But this absolutely </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">stunning</span>
      <span class="c2"> piece of art is...well. It's the most beautiful bow I've ever seen. Yet, you carried no arrows? Why is that? Is this simply an... heirloom of sorts?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I remained silent and he continued talking.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmm. I've been told it's a magic bow, by the men you threatened with no less. Yet, no matter what I did, it refused to bend to my will and show me any wonders other than it's glowing carapace. Therefore, I've concluded that my crippled minion is indeed a great fool and fully deserving of his fate, and that you are no more than an entertainer in the visiting circus show. Still, it is a beautiful piece..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Lukhan gently set the bow upon the chair and confidently strode across the room. He made for an imposing figure, and easily stood at least three heads taller than me. A cold chill seemed to sweep into the room, and I hugged my arms around my chest in a futile attempt to gain a fraction of warmth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"And you, my dear, are no less such a treasure…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Lukhan purred, his voice darkly amused as his gaze roved over me. I could feel his eyes lingering, drinking in my discomfort like fine wine. My stomach twisted as the words struck me with a subtle violence, like the press of a silk-gloved hand tightening around my throat. This wasn’t just a compliment—it was a claim. The man circled around me, looking down like a hunter examining a prize dog.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"More beautiful than the glass beaches of Alathor… though just as drenched, I see. I am sorry for your rough treatment, but it was necessary. You must be curious, about why you were brought to me, and just who I am, yes?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I nodded slowly, suddenly all too aware of my wet clothes revealing the curvature of my body. Lukhan only smirked, seeming to enjoy my discomfort.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well then, I'll be happy to inform you. I am Lukhan, the leader of the Blood Wolves. If you don't know that name then I'm sure you'll be more acquainted with it soon. As for your purpose here, well. That's for me to decide..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The tall man put a hand on my cheek, and I flinched, uneasy of his ominous expression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh you need not be afraid of me...as long as you continue to please me. Tell me, what is your name?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"L-Link…" I answered, unable to keep from shivering, as I was still drenched.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link, hmm? Tsstsstss… that won't do at all. A poorly chosen circus name perhaps." Lukhan chided me like a stablemaster chiding a horse. "From this moment on, you shall be called Sinrah. Yes…. that fits you. Now, before we get you out of those horrid, filthy clothes, you will show me what skills you possess, though likely nothing impressive."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The pirate boss placed his hands on my shoulders and firmly guided me to the throne. To my complete surprise he handed all of my items to me and sat upon the chair. My heart rapidly beat in my chest as I carefully took my mask in my hands, and I knew it was time for my escape.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well go on then, fool. Stop staring like a braindead gibdo and perform for me, show me what uses you have!" Lukhan's raised voice was tinged with venomous cruelty. "Do not anger me, or I shall send you downstream to my sister! I warn you, she's not as kind or forgiving as I am, Sinrah."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Without hesitation, I plunged my face into the mask, a final prayer flickering in the back of my mind—</span>
      <span class="c6 c8">please, let this work</span>
      <span class="c2">. My heart thundered as the air around me seemed to thicken, and the magic responded, surging through me with a heat that drowned out the cold and fear. It was now or never., instantly feeling the changes taking place and growing strength. A moment later, I stood with sword and shield drawn before an extremely surprised Lukhan.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"My name, is Link!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I said defiantly in my original, deep voice before lunging the razor sharp tip of my sword toward the slaver's heart. However, the man was much quicker than I had anticipated, and he rolled out of the chair before my blow struck. In a flash, Lukhan had both of his curved sabres out and slicing through the air for my neck. I raised my shield to deflect them while preparing my stance for another strike. Blade lashed against tempered Hylian steel, sending a jarring vibration up my arm and ringing out a sharp metallic clang that echoed through the chamber, and I responded in kind by stepping forward while slashing with an uppercut. I managed to carve a gash in his left cheek, and he leapt backwards, putting a hand to his face. As his hand came away bloody, the man smirked maliciously.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"My my," Lukhan purred, the corner of his mouth curling upward with unsettling amusement, "you are quite the mystery, Sinrah. I haven't been so caught off guard in years! What other secrets do you possess, hmm?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The pirate sneered, licked a finger coated in his blood, then his smile faded and his expression turned deadly serious.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Lovely girl or fearsome warrior, it matters not. You will die here this day, I assure you!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">With that comment, he came flying across the room with teeth bared and sabres poised to deal death. I blocked and parried blow after blow, using all my past knowledge to keep my body intact. Sparks flew as steel crashed against steel. His blades whistled through the air with each attack speeding to taste my flesh. Lukhan was no pushover, that was for sure, but he was nothing compared to the brute force and power of Ganon. I kept a cool head throughout the duel, pacing myself carefully, but my opponent was beginning to crack either from frustration or exhaustion. His precise strikes and fluid movement from the onset of the duel were now missing their marks. His footwork was becoming more predictable, and his breathing grew more ragged as the battle raged.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What...are...you?!" Lukhan hoarsely sputtered, pronouncing each word with every hit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I chose not to answer, instead grounding myself in the rhythm of the fight—the shifting weight of my stance, the slick hilt in my grip, the heat of battle searing through my limbs. My silence only deepened his fury, each swing of his sabres landing with reckless strength but sloppier form. We circled each other, metal kissing metal in showers of sparks, until we were both gasping from exertion, sweat dripping into our eyes, our bodies trembling with fatigue. Lukhan staggered back at last, chest heaving. His amber eyes locked onto mine, wild and uncertain. The smug mask he wore before had cracked; in its place simmered a volatile blend of rage... and unmistakable fear.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Aaahhhhrrghh!" He fumed, gritting his jaw, and charged me again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Finally, Lukhan made a fatal error, hurling all of his weight into one final, reckless charge. I pivoted hard, muscles tensing, sidestepping the bulk of his assault and driving the tip of my sword toward his chest for a killing blow. But he twisted mid-air like a serpent, the blade slicing through his side instead of piercing his heart. His own sabre caught my right shoulder in the motion, and a searing jolt tore through my arm—a burning, venomous sting that lanced deeper than steel alone should have. A sharp hiss escaped my teeth as we both cried out, our bodies bouncing off each other in a sickening exchange of flesh and metal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Lukhan crashed into a laden table, snapping wood and scattering plates, half-eaten fruit, and spiced meats into a chaotic hail across the stone floor. His blades clattered loose, spinning into the dark corners. I staggered, vision doubling for a heartbeat, the pain in my shoulder pulsing hotter, as if fire were creeping under the skin. Without another word, the heavy chamber doors suddenly burst open.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Sir, is everyth—? What the..! Who..?" the leader stammered, his bearded face blanching.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Unngghh… Don't just </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">cough</span>
      <span class="c2"> stand there, Rastil! Kill her!" Lukhan growled from the floor, blood trailing from his side as he tried to rise, hand slipping in gravy and gore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Sir, is everyth-? What the..! Who..?" The leader's bearded jaw hung open in flabbergasted astonishment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Unngghh… Don't just -cough- stand there, Rastil! Kill her!" Lukhan ordered, struggling to rise at the foot of the table.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I recognized my opportunity for escape and I took it, blood thundering in my ears as I propelled myself forward. My breath came in shallow gasps, the pulse in my wounded shoulder burning like a brand. The world narrowed to a single, desperate instinct: survive. taking advantage of the confused brute standing in the door and dashing toward the throne and scrambled to recover my things. Then I rushed the lead minion with my weapon ready to take him out. He rumbled towards me with a deadly whip blade drawn, the daze apparently clearing from his mind at the last second, but it was too late as my sword was already inches from his throat. After the edge sliced cleanly through beard and bone, I hopped over the now headless body and out into the hall, zooming to where Ratt was being held.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Determined to save my friend, I wouldn't hesitate to cut anyone else down who stood in my way, despite the burning wound in my shield arm. I did my best to retrace Rastil's path from when he brought me to Lukhan, and made my way towards the dungeon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Fortunately, the halls and rooms I passed through were either storage spaces stacked with crates and barrels—reeking of oil, mildew, and gunpowder—or occupied by slouched figures too drunk or dazed to take notice. My boots skidded against puddles of spilled ale and scattered garbage as I limped forward, each jolt in my shoulder sending a white-hot lance through my arm. A few pirates mumbled half-hearted insults or raised tankards in mock salute, mistaking me for some apparition of war—too groggy or too drunk to react in time. My breathing was ragged, harsh in my ears, and the sweat mingling with blood on my brow made my vision blur at the edges.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Then, like a jagged knife across glass, a distant trumpet cry tore through the slumbering haze. The alarm. The spell of confusion shattered instantly—every half-lidded eye snapped toward me, expressions warping from dull amusement to wrathful intent. for arms and supplies, or filled with men and women far too drunk or groggy to really care about my intrusion A few even bumped into me and muttered something insulting or vaguely friendly, then stumbled off in a stupor. Of course, that was until a distant trumpet noise began to blare in alarm, after which every semi-conscious eye immediately turned on me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I bolted with all the speed I could muster, grateful for once of the maze-like corridors that at least gave me some distance from the mob of sloven thugs. Not long after, I found the dilapidated hallway leading to the stairs and took them down two at a time. Upon reaching the bottom, I could hear heavy footfalls and angry yelling coming from above, and I knew I was rapidly running out of time. To my dismay, however, the basement was totally empty! Derzo was gone and the barred metal door was partly open. Was I already out of time?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">With a good kick of my leather boot, the door burst open with a loud metal clash against the stone wall. Yet the room was also completely empty! The manacles sat in several pieces on the stone floor, and the chains were thrown about in a tangled mess. They must've taken Ratt somewhere else since I had triggered the alarm! I backpedaled through the door and dashed back up the stairs in a panic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">As soon as I reached the top, I smacked into the belly of an extremely obese pirate, the impact sending a jolt of pain through my injured shoulder and making me stagger back a step. My arm throbbed violently and I felt my breath hitch from the sudden flare of agony, nearly losing my footing as the stench of rot and alcohol slammed into my senses. I backed away, struggling not to gag, and he pointed a heavy mace toward me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Got yoo! Give it up, scrawny! *burp* Don't make me kill yoo…*belch*!" The clearly drunk bozo grunted with a toothy smile.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Not a chance, just go lay down before you get hurt." I responded in turn.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Fortunately for my wounded arm, I didn't have to fight the hefty drunkard. He grumbled and waddled along toward me and the stairs full steam ahead. All I had to do was simply step aside, and watch him take a tumble and roll down in an avalanche of fat and metal. I shook my head and continued down the old hallways, in the direction of some particularly excessive clatter and taunting. I could only hope that Ratt was putting up a fight, and it wasn't long before I came upon six of the fiends clustered around a closed door.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Get out 'ere or yool be sorry!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yer dead anyway, just make it easy, eh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Just come on out and we'll make it quick n' painless, yeah!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The Blood Wolves all jeered as they pounded on the door, the metal reverberating with a deep, resonant clang that echoed through the hallway like war drums. Each thud rattled the frame, sending dust cascading from the top of the doorframe and making my already frayed nerves buzz with tension.. Forgetting the pain throbbing in my right arm, I all but leapt into the distracted crowd. Shoving my sword into the largest of them, while at the same time using his weight to knock the others around like bowling pins, I cleared the doorway and pulled my sword from the collapsing thug to stand guard at the door. The others stood in stunned fury, and I finally recognized the body on the ground as Derzo. One of the thugs, a smallish man with one eye, abruptly yelled and ran at me brandishing a small sword. I set my jaw and with a forward thrust of my further-reaching blade, he dropped like a sack of flour. The others must've known that they were outmatched at this point, and they fled to get reinforcements. I was sure they'd be back in moments, so I turned to the door and tried kicking it in. Unluckily for me, it was barricaded on the other side. My foot reverberated back in agony, which of course only added to the raging fire burning in my shoulder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Godsdammit!" I barked furiously, and pounded on the door. "Hey, Ratt! Open this damned door!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Go away you idiot losers!" Rang a familiar female voice from the other side. "Wait...Link? Is that you?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Tatl? What are you doing here?" I responded in astonishment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhhh hold on…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A few indecipherable words later and after hearing something big scoot around, the door popped open with the tiny white fairy rushing out to greet me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Holy keese! I saw them take you, and came to save you. But when I got here, I was only able to find Ratt! I thought you were dead, or worse!" Tatl exclaimed joyously and, to my surprise, threw her arms around my neck in the closest thing her tiny body could manage to a hug. Relief washed over me in a sudden, almost dizzying wave, seeing that she was alright, and in that moment, it felt like a spark of strength reignited in my chest despite the blood loss and pain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I thought I was too, but they got sloppy. But you know me, I'm just as good at getting out of trouble as I am getting into it, haha urghh...!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Pffft, true. But that's cuz I'm usually the one who gets you out of it, dummy. Geez! What happened there?" She pointed to my wounded shoulder, and I looked, noticing the entire area soaked in blood.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Just a scratch, no big deal." I smirked and tried to remain optimistic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Pfft...no big deal....what a hero. Maybe we should've just escaped and let you take care of these guys then!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">She joked, patting my face with her palm. Then Ratt crept out of the room, looking down in awe at the bodies of Derzo and the smaller thug.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhhh...wow! Who's this, Tatl? I thought you said it was Link?" Puzzled, Ratt gawked at me in uncertainty.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ohhh….yeah." The fairy only shrugged, "Look. It's a loooong story. I'm sure you'll hear it later, but for now we gotta get out of here!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Agreed, I don't want to spend another second in this dump. And I'm pretty sure their boss wants my head, so the sooner we're gone the better!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Right, uh...Link. Do you know the way out, Tatl?" Ratt asked, sounding dubious.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Not unless you can fit through tiny holes in the roof...ughh. Why can't this place have a map?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Before I could answer, another alarm trumpeted, followed by even more shouting and running. I decided to grab Ratt, knowing Tatl would follow, and bolted in the opposite direction. I had no clue where we were going, but I knew we couldn't stay there. The blood loss must've been getting to me, each step growing heavier as my vision blurred at the edges and my breath came in shallow gasps, ebbing my strength away, so engaging in another bout of combat would likely mean my death.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wait, wait! What about that way?" Ratt pulled me back, gesturing to a hall behind us. "I thought I saw light coming from a window!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Sure enough, there was a window smudged in filth within a trashed room full of cots that could've been a bedroom at one point in time. Now it looked to be used for more...unsavory practices—stained cots, rusted manacles half-hidden beneath grimy sheets, and a musty reek of sweat and despair clinging to the damp air. Everything about the room whispered of pain and secrecy, of lives spent here unwillingly. And I couldn't wait to get out of it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Good eyes, Ratt." I commended, "Uhhh… Let's find something to break it with, hurry!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">He nodded, keeping his confused expression, and we both went about the questionable chamber searching for a heavy object.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6 c8">Hmm paper...Tiny cloth bags… Sausage casings?… Stinky clothes, gross…. Coffee mug, maybe…</span>
      <span class="c2"> I silently talked to myself as I ransacked the room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c12 c26 c6 c8">More clothes… Tobacco pipes… A bottle of…. something? Ah perfect! An iron kettle!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Found something!" I called as I reached for the kettle sitting beside a cot.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">I grasped it off the floor with a gauntleted hand and hurled it through the window, which easily shattered with a loud </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">CLASSHHH</span>
      <span class="c2">! We all rushed to the broken opening, and I heard someone alert the rest of our position not ten meters away. Tatl peeked over the edge and looked back to us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Now or never, we're right on ground level!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt and I nodded and all three of us ducked out the window just as a squad of the Blood Wolves clambered into the room. Although it was still raining, we hit the ground running and turned onto a nearby sidestreet. Yet for some reason as we rounded the corner, Ratt suddenly stopped and pressed his back to the wall of a boarded-up stonework building, his breath coming fast and shallow. His eyes flicked back toward the way we came, wide and glinting with something close to panic. His jaw clenched and his hands tightened into fists at his sides as he peered around the corner, his shoulders hunched with barely restrained tension. It was the posture of someone steeling themselves for a reckless return—the kind you make when someone you care about might be left behind. I grasped his arm in annoyed impatience.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey, where do we go from here?" I asked impatiently, urging Ratt to move. "Don't just stand there!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Look buddy! I don't know who you are, but there's an innocent girl in there who's in trouble right now! And I'm not leaving without her!" The boy whispered resolutely.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wha? No, I'm Link, you dummy. Tatl told you that already!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Pfft yeah right, that was just a bad joke. But the funny business is over, ok? Now are you gonna help me or not?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I wasn't lying, goatbrain." Tatl chimed, flitting in closer. "This is Link, now let's-!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The pixie went silent when we all heard several voices approach, and I wasn't going to wait around to let them find us. Especially since with each passing minute, I was growing weaker and more fatigued. I groaned in frustration and gripped Ratt's arm tightly and began to sprint down the street, dragging him along after me in the opposite direction of the advancing pirate rabble.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey wait! What..? Stop!" Ratt loudly objected.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I ignored his cries to go back, but he eventually simmered down as we fled through twisting alleys and winding streets slick with rain. Each footfall sent a jolt of pain up my right side, the wound throbbing hot and deep beneath my tunic. I was for once grateful for the downpour, not just for the cooling effect it had on my shoulder, but for the haze it cast over the city, masking us from the Blood Wolves' eyes. We had kicked the nest, and they would hunt us down like their namesake. If Lukhan lived—and I feared he did—he wouldn’t stop until I was back in his grip. He wasn't Ganondorf, but the dread that coiled in my stomach said he was close enough.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Eventually, after what felt like an eternity of weaving through the labyrinthine backstreets and narrow passages of the city, we emerged into the edge of the shopping district. The cobbled roads were slick with rain and lined with shuttered stalls and closed shopfronts, their signs creaking faintly in the wind. A few townsfolk darted beneath awnings or held sacks over their heads as makeshift umbrellas, their eyes briefly scanning our disheveled forms before quickly looking away. No one wanted trouble. Especially not the kind trailing behind us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I could barely keep my feet under me. My legs trembled with every step, my breaths were short, shallow, and rattling. My tunic clung to me, soaked in both blood and rain, the poisoned wound in my shoulder now radiating an inferno that pulsed with every heartbeat. Tatl clung to my uninjured shoulder, shouting something I barely heard through the pounding in my skull. I staggered into a side alley, vision swimming, and collapsed against a crate slick with grime and water, using it to stay upright as the world tilted and darkened around the edges.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link, take off the mask! Your body can't handle it anymore!" Tatl exclaimed in worry, trying to peel my face off with her own hands.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I nodded and shakily put a gauntlet up to my face. Ratt only glanced at me before starting to make his way out of the alley, but Tatl rushed over to stop him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey, where are you going? You still gotta take us to that Goron!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Not without Link, Tatl. Thanks for rescuing me and all, but this guy here is a jerk! If you really are her friend, you'll come help me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Before he turned to leave, I managed to pull my mask off, fingers trembling as they gripped the cold, wet edges. The magic surged violently through me, twisting my form with a sharp, breath-stealing pain. My bones compressed, muscles shifting, armor straining against a reshaping body. I let out a strangled cry, the effort shredding the last thread of strength I had left, and began to revert back to my female body—shivering, rain-soaked, and barely conscious as nausea and exhaustion crashed over me in waves. Having no energy left, I collapsed to the watery ground, unable to move.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Link?! Link was that really you?? Gods—you're hurt... you're </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">really</span>
      <span class="c2"> hurt!" Ratt's voice cracked as he dashed to my side and dropped to his knees, cradling my head gently from the cold, rain-slick stone. His hands trembled as they brushed soaked hair from my face, and I could see the shock and guilt etched into every line of his expression. "No, no, no... stay with me, okay? You're gonna be fine. Just—just stay awake. Please."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I opened my mouth to answer, but I couldn't manage to get anything out other than a gasp, my throat tightening as a bitter copper tang coated my tongue. Pain pulsed in my skull, my limbs went numb, and the cold, slick stone beneath me seemed to rise up like a wave. The world blurred and tilted, swallowing me in black. quickly noticing my vision begin to darken. The last thing I saw before blacking out was Ratt's face etched with worry as he leaned over me…</span>

      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"How's she doing, Anju? Any improvement? Has she woken up at all?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I don't know, the wound was frightfully infected when you brought her to me. Looks like the work of some kind of toxin... I've done the best I can, I'm afraid. All that you can do now is wait."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"We can't wait, lady! We have to get to the mountains by tomorrow morning!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'm sorry, Tatl, really… but it's a miracle your friend was even breathing by the time I cleaned her wounds…."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">After faintly hearing bits and pieces of conversation that sounded far away, awareness gradually came back to me in rising waves—like seawater lapping against a fractured hull. I felt the cold press of damp blankets against my skin, the weight of exhaustion like stones on my chest, and a slow throb behind my eyes. Every breath was effort. Every inch of return to consciousness was a climb up from drowning. My body felt like every inch of it had become a wrung out dishrag, and I couldn't move my arms or legs. I had no clue where I was, and all that I did know was that I was lying on something soft and wrapped in blankets. Which definitely wasn't like the stony street that I remembered collapsing on. Did I get moved somewhere?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">My eyes slowly opened, taking their time to adjust to the flickering warmth of a burning fireplace and the golden glow of several large candles. The faint scent of beeswax hung in the air, mingling with the smoky tang of firewood, and the crackle of flames provided a steady rhythm beneath the low murmur of voices. Shadows danced gently on the walls, giving the room a dreamlike quality as my blurred vision tried to bring it all into focus. I could hardly move anything at all, but I glanced around as much as I could. Ratt paced anxiously, wringing his hands and casting frequent glances toward the bed; Tatl hovered mid-air, her glow flickering with agitation; and Anju stood with arms crossed, her brow furrowed in deep concern. The three of them clustered together in the dim, candlelit room, speaking in hushed but urgent tones. I assumed we were in the Stockpot Inn, and judging from the conversation, I had nearly died from...poison? So Lukhan had poisoned his blades then. Typical of an honorless thug...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I tried my best to rise from the bed, but a searing jolt of pain flared through my shoulder, and my muscles trembled as though each fiber had forgotten how to obey. All I managed was a feeble twitch of my arms, as if gravity itself was conspiring to keep me pinned. That slight movement was enough to attract their attention however, as they all rushed over to me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link! You're awake!" Ratt breathed, his voice cracking with emotion. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as his tense shoulders finally sagged, overcome with relief. "Oh thank the gods…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You had me worried sick, dummy!" Tatl exclaimed, her voice trembling slightly as she tapped my nose in mock admonishment. Her glow flickered unevenly, betraying the lingering fear beneath her words. "Stop trying to die on me, okay? Just… don’t do that again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Careful, you two. She still needs time to recover." Anju, the redheaded innkeeper, gently warned before looking at me. "How do you feel, dear?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I opened my mouth to say that I felt like I'd been through a wheat grinder, but the words clung to my tongue like glue. My throat burned with dryness, and frustration pricked at the corners of my mind—how could I not even manage a sentence? My body, weak and uncooperative, reminded me just how close I’d come to the edge. I tried sitting up, but was gently kept in place by Anju.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No no, Miss Link! You mustn't try to move, dear. I still need to stitch up your shoulder. I'll go get you a cup of water for your throat though..." Anju patted my leg beneath the wool blankets, then turned to leave. "Ratt, please don't let her move. I'll be back in a minute."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I heard the door open and close. Then Ratt approached me again, pulling up something wooden to sit on.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey… I'm sorry I was so rude to you in that alley," Ratt began, his voice softer than usual, a flicker of guilt in his eyes. He rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly and avoided my gaze for a moment before finally meeting it with a look of sincere remorse. "I didn't know it really was you…but, I mean, that was amazing! You have all these awesome magic weapons, time traveling flutes, and shapeshifting masks! I'm not sure what Tatl meant about your curse, but... you're incredible! As for all that back there...well, I can't thank you two enough for saving me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hah! Saving you? I regret breaking you out of that dungeon already—do you have any idea how close Link came to dying? And now you're sitting there grinning like it was all some grand adventure! It's your fault Link almost died, you little toad! If it weren't for you, he wouldn't be lying here!" Tatl angrily accused, slapping the boy in the head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ok...yeah… I deserve that," Ratt murmured, his voice low and heavy with guilt. His brows pinched together and he rubbed his arm, eyes flicking briefly to me before dropping again. "If it wasn't for my stupid fight with the Blood Wolves… you'd probably be in the mountains by now. None of this would've happened."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I slowly turned my head, inch by painstaking inch, to scold Tatl and tell her the blame was my own. Yet, my voice refused to cooperate with me, so I tried my best to force my face into an angry expression. All of a sudden the door opened, interrupting the quarrel, and in came Anju carrying a stone mug of water and a small leather satchel. She walked over to the bed, gently lifted my head, and carefully tipped the lifegiving liquid into my mouth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Alright now, not too fast, dear. Drink slowly… that's it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The water tasted infinitely sweet and felt like a cool, soothing river flowing through the parched desert of my throat. For a brief, precious moment, I felt relief ripple through my chest—a fragile comfort that stilled the storm of pain. It was difficult for me not to try to gulp the whole thing down, but I heeded her instructions and sipped slowly. I was glad I did, because as soon as the liquid hit my stomach, I felt nauseous. After I coughed up the water remaining in my throat into the cup, the kindly innkeeper pulled it away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ok, I hope that feels a bit better." Anju said as she set the mug down on a nearby table, and opened up the tiny satchel. "However, I must stitch that shoulder up before it becomes infected again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">She moved to my right and took a curved bone needle from her satchel with some thin twine. I inwardly flinched as the tiny point pierced my skin, but hardly felt anything at all as the twine pulled the skin over the wound. A competent innkeeper, a skilled physician, a diligent sister.... Anju moved with the quiet confidence of someone who’d carried others through pain like this before. Her touch was steady, her voice gentle, and even her frown seemed to promise safety. what wasn't this woman good at? With a slight tug and snip later, Anju sealed the wound and re-bandaged it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"There you go, now all that you need is a few days of rest. But please, don't go playing in that dreadful sewer again, young miss. You were very lucky to come out with only an infected scratch. And Ratt, </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">shame</span>
      <span class="c2"> on you for taking her there in the first place! I swear I don't understand you boys and your disgusting hideouts! It's bad enough that Jim sneaks around down there, but involving her in your schemes is appalling!" Anju chided the sullen-faced boy, thumping him with her finger. "Now... I have to go back to work downstairs, someone is bound to show up in this dreadful weather. If you need me, I'll be at the desk in the lobby. Oh, and if you get hungry later I have soup cooking in the kitchen. You know where that is, Ratt."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">With that, Anju quietly shut the door, leaving the three of us to talk. Seeing the slight confusion in my eyes, Ratt gave a sheepish smile, his brows knit together with concern, and rubbed the back of his neck before beginning to clarify Anju's previous statement.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah...I had to tell her a little white lie about us playing in the sewer. She would've turned us away if we mentioned anything about the Blood Wolves. Her mom, the mayor's awful wife, has a little deal with them. Basically they have free reign in their territory as long as they don't cross lines, and the town guard won't harass them. All in the name of 'avoiding a costly war' in her terms. Anju is the exact opposite of her mother, but she would've refused to deal with you if you were connected in any way to those brutes."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh...thank you…" Was all I could manage to utter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I inwardly groaned in irritation as a dull throb pulsed from my wound, echoing with each frustrated heartbeat. How long was it going to take to even move? My arms felt like lead, and a faint ache curled through my limbs, sharpening the helplessness that gripped me.? How badly was I injured? What time was it? I couldn't even see a window. I had places to get to, a Goron child to rescue… if the Gorons were even still there…and I had to get to those northern mountains.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey, Link, don't worry." My fairy companion rubbed my forehead, noticing the frustration in my eyes. "I know you must be fretting over the Goron and the mountains. But, you have no idea how close to death you were. You need rest, ok?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No...ugh...I have to...get up!" I gasped, struggling to rise.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link please, we're serious." Ratt put pressure on my good shoulder to keep me pinned. "You're gonna need at least half your strength. This may be a safe place for now, but as soon as we leave, the Blood Wolves are gonna be onto us and plan another ambush."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ugh...fine." I relented, suddenly feeling thirsty again. "Water...please?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Good, and yes of course!" Ratt happily obliged and returned the cup of water to my lips.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I managed to drink down a few sips, until the ground started to rumble. Ratt pulled the glass away, standing up from his chair and glanced around apprehensively.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What is that?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"The moon, idiot." Tatl stated, almost nonchalantly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"The moon? Like that creepy-faced moon we saw yesterday? So… it really is gonna fall unless you two stop it…" The concerned boy ignored the fairy's insult.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I feebly nodded and Ratt sat back down in despair.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Man… So, everything the Bombers have been fighting for… all the wrongs needing to be made right…. it doesn't mean a thing after all. We're doomed anyway..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Pretty much." The obnoxious fairy sneered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No." I muttered hoarsely in disagreement, giving Tatl a stern look. "It...does matter. This world…*huff*... isn't over yet."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You really think it'll survive? Even if you guys manage to stop the moon? I mean, look at all the evil this world has in it, and what good has this world ever done for you? Look at yourself, Link. You're lying on what we thought was your deathbed, barely able to move or talk! All because of those villains you're trying to save…-sigh-... I don't know how you do it….or why."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt was silent for a while, just blankly gazing at the floor. I tried mustering what little strength I had to speak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I...do it because...of people like you, Ratt. Yes…-huff- there is evil...and corruption. But, there...is also a lot of...good, and -huff-... purity. We have to...fight for it…-gasp-... If not, what else do we have?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The strain of speaking for so long was, pathetically, far too much for my body to handle. Exhausted, I shut my eyes and focused on calming my heavy breathing. Ratt remained silent, as did Tatl. The only sound in the room was the gentle crackling of the lively fireplace, and would have almost been peaceful if not for the subject of doom looming on everyone's thoughts. A faint peel of thunder rumbled outside, and I suddenly felt a light touch on my good shoulder. Opening my eyes and tilting my head to the left, I saw Ratt with renewed determination burning within his eyes. His face no longer held the awkward smirk that seemed permanently plastered on his lips, but a serious, willful grimace that seemed misplaced on the normally light-hearted boy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You're right, Link. I know I've been a burden on you and Tatl...but I want to be better. I've tried to make this town better, I've helped a few people, sure...but it's nothing compared to what you can probably do. If you had to, you could probably save an entire kingdom!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Umm….I have…" I muttered weakly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ha, exactly! You'll have to tell me about that story later… But, well...if it's not too much to ask...I want you to train me. If you, uh... want to that is…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Pfft! Train you? Why would Link waste any time on you? You're just a street urchin. Haven't you done enough to him?" Tatl bemoaned and flew in between me and Ratt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Tatl...I know I've been a terrible friend, I do. I can take your abuse. But Link can't defend herself, so cool it on the insults ok?" Ratt sternly upbraided the white fairy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"What are you talking about, moron? I'm not mocking him. I'm telling </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">you </span>
      <span class="c2">to step off!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"You keep calling Link </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">him</span>
      <span class="c2">! I know it must be a jab at that mask form, but now is not the time."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Ughh you imbecile! Link is a </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">man!</span>
      <span class="c6"> The mask form is his </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">real form</span>
      <span class="c2">! Remember the curse I was talking about?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt was abruptly taken aback, looking down at me, then at Tatl, then back to me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link… is Tatl bothering you? I can make her wait outside if you-"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Put me outside? I'd like to see you try! I may be small, but I've knocked out </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">badbats</span>
      <span class="c2"> worse than you!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl angrily swooped in front of Ratt's face, her wings buzzing with irritation, while Ratt clenched his fists and leaned forward, his jaw tight and eyes narrowed. The room crackled with their unspoken challenge, but I quickly broke the tension the only way I could. With a few soft coughs, I managed to get their attention again and Ratt leaned over me, while Tatl fluttered close to my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Are you ok, Link?" They both asked in unison.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wa..ter…" I wheezed and, after Ratt poured a little of the life-giving fluid into my mouth, continued with an explanation. "Tatl is...right...I was a man… Skullkid…*huff*...cursed me, so here I am…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"Oh… Wait, what? You… were actually </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">transformed into a girl</span>
      <span class="c6">?" Ratt dubiously responded, but after double </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">checking</span>
      <span class="c6"> my serious expression, he sat down. "Holy cucco…why? And how? Aren't skull kids normally...like... powerless forest creatures? I've heard stories of them pulling pranks… but, well… </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">never</span>
      <span class="c2"> anything like that."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"He has this powerful mask, and uses it for cruel pranks." Tatl chimed in and paraphrased my story, with her tone thankfully less accusatory towards Ratt. "I know, cuz... I was Skull Kid's friend… once anyway. Basically me, my brother, and Skull Kid were playing in the woods one day. We found Link here riding this awesome horse, ambushed him and stole the horse. Link followed, and bibbity bobbity boop, Skull Kid cursed him. Now the only way Link can return to his former body is through his mask."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt rubbed his temples thoughtfully, his eyes wide and brows furrowed, as the weight of the story settled on him like a heavy cloak. A trace of disbelief flickered across his face, quickly replaced by something deeper—shock, maybe, or awe—as he looked from Tatl to me and back again, trying to fit the pieces together in his mind. I looked up at Tatl, who had guilt written over her petite features. I knew she still felt bad about her part in everything. I was about to say something to console her, but before I could, Ratt slapped his knees in conviction and rose from his creaky stool.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link… we're going to find a way to save you." The willful boy leaned over me to look me in the eye. "First of all, I believe your story. Mutoh, the person I went to see the other night, was also transformed into something, a man-bull thing, and said something about a wicked trickster wearing a dark mask. This monster must be the one causing the moon to fall, too! I can help you, but you just gotta train me to fight like you can! I am ready and willing to learn."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ohhh no. You're not tagging along." Tatl refused before I could utter a response. "We have enough problems as it is, ok? Ok. Good. Glad we solved that."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What can I do to prove that I can help?" Ratt pleaded, more to me than Tatl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You know what? How about you start by finding a way to heal Link? Pfft... Oh, wait, if you leave you'll be caught by your friends. Yeah, go do that." The fairy sarcastically replied.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Alright. Hold on, Link. I'll be back soon."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">W-wait it's pitch black outside! I was only kidding abo-!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">The door opened and shut with a soft </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">click</span>
      <span class="c2"> before Tatl finished her sentence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Welp...he's as good as dead…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Why did you… do that?" I scowled at the fairy, feeling my anger rise.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"I didn't think he would actually </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">go out there</span>
      <span class="c2">! I'm sorry, I'll go get him real quick."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl zipped over to the door, and I heard her loud attempts at opening it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Stupid door! Just….open…! Ughh! Why... won't... you...open!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A few minutes of pulling, shoving, and kicking passed until the pixie finally gave up on her futile attempts at opening the door.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I can't get it open…" Tatl sadly stated as she returned to my side, her wings drooping a little. "I guess I shouldn't have been so harsh… sorry." She hovered lower, her glow dimming slightly, a flicker of genuine regret crossing her usually brash voice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I sighed at my companion's appalling behavior, and closed my eyes. If Ratt didn't return with something helpful, if he returned at all for that matter, I would need more strength to go find him or the goron. If there was still time to do anything at all.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c12 c6 c8 c26">Wait… what time is it?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I opened my eyes and glimpsed Tatl sitting beside my head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What time is it… anyway?" I inquired in a frail voice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh, yeah… well, it's definitely after dark. You were out for a long time…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Great…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You know," Tatl shuffled closer to my face, "How come it's always the second day that gives us the most trouble? Is it the rain? Or is the entire world out to get us on this particular day?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I had to smile at her observation, it seemed odd that we were always up this same creek every cycle of the second day. Yet, I could see a kind of dark humor in it as well.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ha… yeah. I guess we're… just lucky." I breathed in response, suddenly feeling the exhaustion from so much conversation take over. "But I'm... feeling… really tired. I'm gonna… just take a...nap…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">My eyelids fell shut like heavy stone doors and I was fast asleep in moments. It felt like only a few minutes passed when I heard Tatl call my name and felt the warmth of her tiny hand patting my shoulder, rousing me from a dreamless sleep. The scent of old wood and faint herbs filled the air, and I blinked against the soft amber glow of candlelight flickering on the inn’s wooden walls. and felt someone pat my shoulder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link, hey Link! Wake up, Ratt actually pulled it off!" Her excited voice echoed in the small room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">My eyes opened again to see Tatl hovering over my face, and I turned my head and noticed that the triumphant boy stood beside me, holding a bottle of something shiny in his hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Is that…?" I inquired in apprehensive excitement.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hehe yup! A pink fairy." Ratt chuckled, opening the bottle to release the tiny helper. "The Great Fairy let one of her children come with me. But it was weird, she acted like she knew you two already?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"She remembered us? Wow! Most forget we even exist… it must be because she's the Great Fairy." Tatl presumed with a shrug as her kin fluttered to me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yes, the Great Mother remembers you saving her from certain doom." The pink fairy spoke in a sweetly child-like voice. "She also desires to repay the favor!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The healing pixie swirled around me and immediately set to work. A soft pink glow radiated from her tiny body, leaving behind a trail of sparkles that melted into my skin like warm raindrops. I felt a tingling warmth sink into my flesh, knitting torn muscles and cleansing the lingering sting of poison in my veins. My breathing deepened, the ache in my bones slowly receding as strength trickled back into me like sunlight returning after a storm. My fingers twitched, then flexed. My chest loosened. And then, with a tremble, I sat up, gasping softly. The blanket slipped from my shoulders, and a sudden draft chilled my now-sensitive skin, making me acutely aware of my bare arms.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Looking down, I felt a cold spike of vulnerability shoot through me as I realized I was wearing nothing but a simple, brown bra. My skin prickled with goosebumps from the drafty room, and I scrambled to pull the bedsheets higher to cover myself. Embarrassed, Ratt quickly turned away and dashed over to a nearby table where my clothes were placed, dry and neatly folded. Keeping his face turned, he handed the garments to me, and I swiftly pulled the brown tunic over my head just as the tiny healer finished her miracle work.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Pfft...show off…" I heard Tatl mutter under her breath, clearly annoyed by the pink fairy's useful magic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"All done! Mother will be happy that I was able to help!" the pink fairy cheerfully hummed, either not catching Tatl's comment or choosing not to care. "But now I've gotta get back to my family. If you would kindly let me out, please?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh yeah, no problem!" Ratt obliged and opened the door.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">As the fairy exited with a polite 'thank you,' I pulled my legs—thankfully clothed—out from under the blanket and set my bare feet onto the cool wood flooring of the room. I gently rose, testing my balance, still wincing faintly at the lingering soreness in my limbs. Tatl bobbed in the air, but something in her movements felt gentler than usual—like a flicker of relief disguised in playful energy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You're okay!" she blurted, her voice just a little too loud with emotion. "Well, for now anyway.... A-at least until I have to come save you again, haha!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I looked at her more closely—she was hovering a little too low, her light dimmer than usual, and there was a hitch in her voice she couldn't quite hide.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oho you're so funny, Tatl," I replied with soft sarcasm as I walked over to the table holding the rest of my gear. "But I think it was Ratt who came through this time."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What? I didn't do anything… if anything I was just making up for getting you in that position in the first place," Ratt said with a touch of guilt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Shyeah! You did cause us all that grief!" Tatl flitted before him, but her tone had softened just slightly. "But… you did throw yourself to the wolves—literally—in order to help Link. I guess that counts for something. But you're still a moron."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I caught a flicker of something strange in Tatl’s eyes—maybe a hint of respect, or even gratitude.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Don't worry, Ratt. She'll warm up to you eventually," I said with a small smile, sliding on my scaled, green cloak and gloves. "You should've seen us when we first met. Hmm… actually, now that I think about it, we haven't really changed much heehee!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey! That's only because you always do dumb stuff!" Tatl huffed. "Like... blabbing your mouth while we should be moving on! We only have one day left to get to those mountains, you know?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ok ok, I hear you. Don't worry though, I've got my ocarina still. Even if we don't make it to the mountains, we'll try again next cycle," I said while pulling on my boots and slinging the lustrous bow around my back. "Ratt, if you would, please lead on and take us to the kid?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah, no problem! It's...ah... good to see you up on your feet again. We just have to get to the west market. The guy there is open all night, which is honestly perfect timing, I'd say."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt waited for me to gather the rest of my things, then opened the door. We quietly left the room. I considered thanking Anju again for her immense kindness, but the urgency of our situation held my tongue. She was likely asleep anyway. I would find a way to repay her...truly...when I could.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The inn was silent, though candles burned in wall sconces that cheerily lit the quaint second-floor hallway. The faint creak of ancient floorboards echoed beneath our steps, mingling with the subtle scent of old wood and melted wax. A trail of damp puddles along the hardwood floor, likely left by Ratt, led downstairs into the main lobby. No one manned the front desk at this hour, so we slipped out the front door and into the sparsely lit streets lying under a black, cloud-smothered sky.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ok, so it shouldn't be long if we keep to the main streets. Everyone's asleep, so it'll be easy going," Ratt said as we started walking. "I didn't see any sign of the Blood Wolves. Hopefully they gave up for the night. Speaking of… how did you escape from their boss? I've never met him personally, but I've heard he's practically unbeatable! Some say he wears armor blessed with dark magic."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well, funny story actually. He kinda just... gave me my mask and told me to entertain him."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hahaha what?! I bet you did just that! I wish I could've seen the surprise in his eyes as you gutted him like the swine he was…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Umm, actually he was pretty quick on his feet... and probably the toughest human opponent I've fought in a long time. I didn’t get a killing blow, but it seems he almost did with those poisoned blades. Honorless scum…" I growled in contempt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hey, I'm just glad you got away—and got us all out alive, for that matter." Ratt paused, eyes lingering on mine with a flicker of awe and something deeper, a yearning. "But I was serious earlier when I asked you about the training thing…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">He rubbed the back of his neck, voice softening. His eyes looked deep into mine, stirring that weird sensation in my chest once again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"I want to save people. I want to do what you do. You're... you're like the kind of hero I always imagined as a kid—strong, fearless, someone who </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">makes</span>
      <span class="c2"> things right. I want to learn how to do that too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Look kid, you helped Link out a ton…" Tatl cut in, "But I don't think you would survive one minute as a—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ratt…" I interrupted with a weary sigh. "You don't want my life. Being a warrior means committing yourself to a life of violence, and pain. Just look at where it got me…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I gestured to my cursed body, but the boy simply shrugged.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"I see nothing wrong. So you got turned into a </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">female</span>
      <span class="c2"> warrior. So what? That's not stopping you from saving an entire world. So why would I stop asking you to train me to do the same?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I...ugh…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I had no response. The kid sounded just like I did when I was younger—back when I was a child just beginning his adventure in Kokiri Forest. I may have been Ratt’s age in body, but I was at least double it in mind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You're way too headstrong for your own good." I conceded, "I... suppose I could show you a few things… But you aren't coming to the mountains with us. You need to stay in town where it's relatively safe…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"...Safe? Ohhh not for you, I'm afraid…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We all stopped in our tracks to search for the disembodied voice of Lukhan, who must have been hidden in the shadows ahead. Unfortunately, dozens of angry, raggedy pirates slowly stepped out of nearby alleyways and closed storefronts, all rushing to surround us. I cursed our rotten luck as I took a more defensive stance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You see, Sinrah. I own this city. I have men in every district, and when I don't… well, everything is for sale, even loyalty. My influence strikes fear into even the mayor himself!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Lukhan finally revealed himself with a slow, deliberate step into the amber glow of a burning street lamp. His presence was heralded by the metallic hiss of twin scimitars unsheathing, the sound sending a chill down my spine. A faint, acrid scent of smoke and blood clung to him, as if the violence he wrought followed him like a shroud. He smiled, cold and predatory, the expression twisting the raw, unbandaged wound across the left side of his face—a wicked, jagged cut that traced his cheek like a grim badge of vengeance. Thirty meters away, he simply stood there....silent, looming, terrible.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ah yes, do you like this little gift you've left me with? I rather fancy it myself. In fact, I fancy it so much I may just share it with you! Your companions, however, will be slaughtered in front of you. Much like you slaughtered my best man. Rastil will rest easy, knowing you suffered before your slow, painful demise."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link!" Tatl hissed urgently, "Play your ocarina...hurry!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I nodded, and from the look on Ratt's face I knew he understood, too. We all huddled together as the pirate thugs closed off any escape route. Lukhan approached slowly, wary of any surprises. I carefully went for my instrument, watching the boss like a hawk. His malicious smile widened as he saw me reaching further into my cloak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ah yes, show me the warrior! I would relish another duel, haha!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">When my hand came out with the ocarina instead, Lukhan's cocky smile instantly twisted into a snarl. He roared and came sprinting toward us, but the instrument was already to my lips. I played the Song of Time with my heart racing and eyes closed. Each beautiful note seemed to echo out in waves of azure molasses. The world itself seemed to slow down, and all noise faded into the background…</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">When I finished the magical tune, my eyes opened to see Lukhan and his blades inches from my face. My galloping heart skipped a beat, expecting a killing blow. But it was too late for his strike to connect. The town around us swirled and stretched into white lines, which expanded until all four of us were engulfed in an ocean of white. Lukhan's eyes bulged with fear and shock, and he screamed in rage as he began to fade from our sight. The last traces I saw of him before completely disappearing were his eyes, focused on mine and filled with a furious, immeasurable hate...</span>

    </h1>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The sight of immense cliffs and towering stone formations greeted Majora's gaze, the baking heat pressing down on him like a physical weight. The scent of scorched stone and dry, bitter sagebrush filled the air, evoking a wave of sun-bleached memories from his youth. on his return to the land of his ancestors. A cloudless blue sky hung over a sun-blasted wasteland, all without the hint of a breeze to ease the relentless heat pouring from the sun. Despite the harsh landscape, Majora welcomed the familiar surroundings of his childhood and took a deep breath. The scents of dry dust and acrid desert flowers filled his nostrils, and a smile crossed Majora's lips from beneath the dark mask.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Home, sweet home. Almost."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Spotting the faded symbol of a circular, cyan eye that marked the trail to his village, Majora widened his smile and started down the path.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The canyon trail was only a few feet in width, with steep cliffs on either side creating a maze of claustrophobia. Although it was the main road to the village, the path looked as if it hadn't been used in years. Sharp stones from broken cliffsides lay strewn along the road, along with patches of weedy, thorned shrubbery. Cracked and broken sculptures, carved into the cliffsides by the slaves, depicted faceless, yet powerful figures—legendary warriors and ancient sages of Sheikah lore, their features long since worn away by time and neglect.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Fools. All of them," Majora uttered. "No need for the dead to be remembered."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">With a wave of his hand, dark energy surged into the rock and obliterated the remains of the carvings, creating a vast cloud of dust within the canyon. The statues wouldn't be the only victims this day. Majora planned a similar fate for his former tribe. All he wanted was strength for his people—he gave them the solution to their problems! The council asked for a tool that rivaled the very essence of the gods, an equal to the Triforce itself. Majora and his acolytes created that power, but what was their reward?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Banishment! Death! Madness!" Majora shouted into the echoing trail, gently caressing the mask he wore. The mask pulsed faintly with a malevolent aura, exuding a subtle, dark residue that shimmered like smoke in the air. It was feeding off his fury, amplifying it. "I created this from my own soul!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The wrathful man marched forward with a determined pace, unfazed by the ocean of dust obscuring his vision. Soon the path cleared and began to incline up a hill. Majora knew he was close; the slave quarters were situated just at the top of this ridge. The Sheikah city lay just beyond, and sweet revenge would soothe Majora's tortured spirit as he tore the high council apart with his bare hands.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Upon reaching the top, Majora was taken aback by complete silence. He looked around at the empty huts and broken architecture, a stark contrast to the once lush and thriving quarters. There was no life whatsoever. The state of the area almost appeared as if a revolt took place long ago, but how? The slaves were utterly devoted to their Sheikah masters, who were revered as gods. No, it was impossible! Gerudo were foolish and simple, but not so much as to risk the wrath of True Sheikah magic. Something else must have happened. Majora ran down the path to his former village. This road should have been swarming with people.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Impossible! Did they know I was coming?" Majora gasped as fury rose within him. "Curse them! Curse them all!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Sure enough, the entire village was deserted, just as desolate as the slave quarters. As he dashed past buildings toward the high council chambers, Majora met the same stillness that seemed to haunt the entire region. Not only was this formerly bustling village devoid of people, but it was completely stripped of resources. The only remaining sign of civilization was bare, ruined infrastructure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No. No it cannot be. Gone... all gone." Majora collapsed to his knees on the cracked, lifeless ground, his breath catching in his throat as a tidal wave of grief and fury crashed over him. The sun above seemed to burn with cruel indifference, and his fingers dug into the dusty soil as if trying to anchor himself to a world that had betrayed him. The mask began to exude that same oily shadow, hungrily drinking in his anguish and radiating a low thrum of dark energy. "They cannot escape me. I will find them! Rrrraaaaagghhh!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A violent shriek escaped Majora's throat as he allowed his body to be overtaken by pure malice. Cold, shadowy energy seeped from his body and extended outwards. Rocks and pebbles floated into the air as ethereal darkness covered the area, creeping up the walls of the surrounding buildings. The very air itself began to vibrate and hum with power. Finally, the dark energy reached the perimeter of the town, and Majora closed his eyes, unleashing his will into the earth. The entirety of the ruins was instantly vaporized in a single deafening, catastrophic explosion, and Majora lost consciousness as the wave of pure darkness washed over him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Narri was a young Gerudo huntress-in-training and often came to the Cliffs of Despair for practice. Prey was scarce here, which made the challenge even greater, and more fun. She had done this run many times with her mother, but this was the first time Narri came by herself. It was the first of many coming-of-age trials that the young Gerudo would face, and she was shaking with nervous anticipation at proving herself worthy of adulthood.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Narri hunkered down at the base of a rock upon seeing the fresh tracks of a coyote, her keen eyes narrowing with practiced focus. Though still considered young, she had spent countless hours tracking desert prey alongside her mother and sisters, learning to interpret even the faintest impressions in the dust. The spacing, depth, and freshness of the prints told her the animal had passed through moments ago—and it was alone. Her pulse quickened at the thought of proving her skill without guidance for the first time. Using the sensing techniques her mother had taught her, Narri removed the silk bandana covering her face and closed her eyes to "feel" the desert. The blistering heat of the noontime sun, arid breeze, rustling of the sun-bleached grass—and for some reason a peculiar sense of uneasiness throughout the entire area. The huntress opened her eyes to search around. Something was wrong, but she did not know what. She tried to sort the strange feeling out, until a flash of gray fur darting behind a boulder caught Narri's attention.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The coyote!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Narri repositioned her bandana over her face to muffle her excited breathing. This was her chance! She crept closer to the opposite side of the boulder, carefully balancing each step to remain silent. Taking up a loose pebble in her left hand and hoisting her spear in the right, Narri prepared her strike. Just before she threw the pebble to startle her prey out of hiding, a massive explosion rocked the earth and not only threw Narri to the ground but caused the coyote to flee in terror. Narri lifted her head to see a bright purple flash of light rise into the sky below the old ruins just before a cloud of dust swept over the cliffs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Shaken, a bit terrified, yet angry at losing her prey, the young Gerudo stood to her feet and began walking through the thick blanket of dust to investigate the explosion. Her great-grandnana had told Narri and her sisters stories of the ancient ruins where their gods dwelt on earth. Of how the Gerudo were faithful servants and were granted a peaceful life free of thirst and starvation. Some Gerudo were even taught how to use the shadow magic that the gods often wielded. That was before a huge war was waged on the sacred lands of Hyrule, when her great-grandnana was a small child. The Hylian gods must have been victorious, since no one had seen or heard anything from the old gods for nearly a century. But why was there activity here now? Had the gods returned at last? Curious, Narri made the hike to the ruins.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The sun was nearly to the horizon by the time Narri reached the edge of the ruins. The fog of dust had settled into a slight haze, so the huntress could see what awaited her. A vast crater stretched before Narri where the ancient ruins once were. Sinuous markings within the crater snaked toward the epicenter of the devastation, where the Gerudo saw a faint humanoid figure. Narri quickly rushed to the fallen being, sliding and hopping down the walls of the depression to see if it was alright, or at least worthy of looting. The coyote was a good prize, but the possibilities of this creature being related to the old gods was historical. Her people would recognize her as an adult for sure, and then she could at last explore the world on her own!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">When Narri arrived at the center, she was surprised to find an odd masked man lying unconscious. The tendril-like markings etched into the rock seemed to emanate from him like rays of winding light. Narri bent down to see if he was alive, her heart pounding with a mix of awe and apprehension. Could this truly be one of the old gods her great-grandnana spoke of? A sense of reverence and ambition welled up within her—if she brought back proof, her place in Gerudo society would be secured. With trembling fingers, she searched the torn clothing for any valuables.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hmm… Nothing. Maybe this mask will be worth something."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Narri spoke to herself as she reached toward the odd, heart-shaped mask. However, as soon as she touched the cold wood, the man's hand shot up and grasped her arm in a vice-like grip. Narri screeched in pain and fear as the grip tightened, nearly crushing her bones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What are you doing, slave?" the masked man spoke.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oww, ow, ow I-I was just checking to, owww, see if you were unhurt?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Lies!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Narri suddenly flew several meters and crashed to the ground. Her spear had fallen quite a distance away, but she couldn't leap up to retrieve it as she was held down by some unseen force. The masked man rose from the ground and was standing over her in the blink of an eye.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Are you... a god?" Narri gasped in pain, struggling to move.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"To you I am, slave," the man stated imperiously. "You may be of use to me. What happened to my home?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Your... urgh... home? You lived here? Auuuughh!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Narri shrieked as a flash of purple shot toward her, severing her left ear and slicing the silk bandana from her face. The man slouched as he dropped his radiating hand, clearly weakened by something.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You… should be grateful I'm in a gracious mood today. Your kind must have forgotten how to behave. From now on you will address me as 'Master,' and speak only when I give you permission. Now, I'll ask again. What happened to my home?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I-l-l don't know, uh...m-master! The gods disappeared almost a century ago! I'm sorry!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"A century? You don't happen to know where, do you?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, I don't know anything except for the stories my great-grandnana told!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Majora glared at the quivering slave girl in contempt. Such an impudent creature, speaking to him as an equal. Even in his weakened state caused by his uncontrolled outburst, Majora was far stronger than this worm. She was definitely of the Gerudo though, with tanned skin, scarlet hair, and a well-muscled body suited for hard labor. Yet Majora had no use for a slave—what he needed was information and a safe place to recover his energy. This girl could take him to her home to rest, and perhaps to one of the slaves who knew the cause of his people's disappearance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hmm. You will take me to your village to see your elder."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yes! I can do that, but my great-grandnana is—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Silence," Majora interrupted, shooting a tiny bolt of energy into Narri's arm. "You will remember to hold your tongue, or you will lose it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Aghh aghhh! Yes, m-master!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Majora gestured at the desperate Gerudo to rise off the ground, removing the unseen magic bindings. Narri immediately flung one hand to her bleeding head while searching for her severed ear. Majora kicked the girl harshly in the calves and motioned for her to move on.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Forward, slave."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Narri tearfully obeyed, every step a struggle against the trembling in her legs. Her vision blurred with tears and the sharp sting of pain in her head. She wished with every fiber of her being that she had ignored the explosion and hunted the coyote instead. Her heart ached for the safety of her family—her mother’s strong arms, her sisters’ laughter, the warm light of home. And above all, she clung desperately to one hope: that she would live through this nightmare.</span>

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The dawn of the first day began again as usual, with birdsong weaving through the crisp morning air and the scent of dew-laced cobblestones rising in gentle waves—but Ratt, Tatl, and I were far too on edge to enjoy the sunshine and cheery morning. The phantom sting of Lukhan’s envenomed blades still clung to my shoulder. The echo of his cold, sardonic voice flickered at the edge of memory like a shadow that hadn’t quite vanished. The warmth on my face felt almost insulting after what we’d just survived. We had been only seconds away from certain death, and I quietly thanked the gods for our escape. All three of us swayed unsteadily as we regained our bearings from the rapid shift through time—that nauseating tumble through space that left our limbs tingling, our stomachs roiling, and a cold rush lingering in our veins like the echo of some deep, cosmic current... Tatl and I were more familiar with it, but Ratt still struggled to remain upright.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"W-whoa, for a minute there... I thought... we were finished." Ratt gasped, stumbling a step before bending down and clutching his stomach. His face had gone pale, a cold sweat glistening along his brow, and his eyes darted around as if expecting the pirate lord to leap from the shadows. His voice trembled slightly when he added, "W-what happened to Lukhan?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I don't know, but I'm glad he's not here..." I said, though my voice shook with something closer to wariness than relief. That was far too close for comfort. I could practically see the raging hatred in his eyes still lingering before me. I grasped at the shoulder where his blade met my flesh yesterday. Still healed...thank the gods... I quickly looked up to Tatl to make sure she was also unharmed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Are you okay, Tatl?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah, and I think we're all lucky to be alive. In any case, we should probably get out of town as soon as possible in case they come looking!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl fluttered around my head, casting frantic glances at the nearby rooftops and alleys. I found myself scanning them too, half-expecting Lukhan's shape to materialize from the shadows, blade drawn and memory intact. Her wings trembled faintly, betraying more fear than her voice let on. Then her tone shifted, just a little too eagerly—almost like she was trying to move the conversation past the terror still clinging to all of us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh... right! The Gorons must be looking for their kid about now! Remember that guy you mentioned, Ratt? Do you think he still has the Goron child?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt, still hunched and pale from the twisting effects of time travel, grimaced as he swallowed down the bile rising in his throat. He wiped his mouth on his sleeve, then paused, blinking hard like he was trying to remember where—when—they were. His voice was hoarse when he finally answered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'm pretty sure he does. And I gotta agree with you on this one, Tatl. We need to get out of here, and fast." He took my hand like it was the one stable thing left in a world gone sideways, gripping it with trembling fingers. "C'mon. He's just south of the shopping district."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We raced through the plaza, which was steadily filling with bustling shoppers and bright-eyed tourists, their cheerful chatter clashing with the raw tension still tightening in my chest. The scent of baked bread, crushed flowers, and woodsmoke hung heavy in the thick morning air—so warm and inviting it felt like a cruel joke. It was as though the world had shrugged off the darkness we’d just endured, refusing to acknowledge the terror that had clung to our skin like ash.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Beside me, Ratt weaved through the crowd like someone born in these streets, his grip on my hand a lifeline as we threaded through narrow alleys and between carts piled high with goods. His focus never wavered. Not until we reached a street so silent and grimy it felt like it had been forgotten on purpose.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Iron bars barricaded the windows of several buildings that sat in a jumbled row, with each door sporting multiple locks made of solid steel. The building we finally stopped before had a metal sign reading "The Curiosity Shop" written in ornate gold lettering, dulled by years of dust and neglect.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Here we are, I've known this guy for a long time," Ratt began in a hushed tone, matching the silence of the empty corridor. "He's the only pawn shop in town, and he owns most of these buildings—used to run with the thieves' guild before he went legit, or so he claims. He has contacts all over Termina that sell or trade all kinds of valuable artifacts to him. Geroh may seem like a thieving lowlife at first, but trust me, he's got a heart of gold."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I trust you, but let's try to hurry." I nodded, warily glancing around. The hairs on my neck still hadn’t settled, something was off.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt continued to hold my hand, his grip steady but warm, as he walked up and rapped his knuckles on the iron-reinforced door. The tension in his shoulders hadn’t eased, and I could feel the unspoken urgency in the way his fingers curled just slightly tighter around mine. For the first time I was actually grateful for his comforting presence. A few seconds later, a thin, nasally voice sounded within.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ratt? Is that you? Whatchoo want?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I want to know if you have any Goron kids?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Goron kids? How can I have any kids if I ain't got a wife? 'Specially a Goron, ya dunce! The only kid I ever gotta deal with is you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"C'mon Geroh, I know someone sold you a Goron kid recently."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"...Maybe they did, maybe they didn't. Why d'you care anyhow? This another one of your 'hero' escapades?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Look, you know as well as I do that this town is already on the brink of anarchy. If the Gorons end up declaring war on us because you stole one of their young, this town won't survive, taking your business with it. You don't want to risk losing all of this, do you?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt gestured with his arm at all the buildings along the street, and the heavy door finally opened after six loud clicks, revealing a short, chubby man with neatly combed brown hair and a short-trimmed black beard. The smell of oil, dust, and old parchment wafted from inside.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Harumph…you always did have a good head on your shoulders, kid. Come on inside. And uh, bring your company in too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Geroh waved us in and held open the door while glancing suspiciously at Tatl and me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">There were no windows inside the structure, but it was well lit by dozens of candles and torches. The walls had several large crates hastily stacked against them, with the back wall featuring a solid steel door, which looked much like a safe. The middle of the room was empty aside from a few wooden chairs and a green plaid sofa. A glass table in the shape of a rupee, supported by jade figurines of goddess-like women posed in flowing robes, sat at the very center. The front door shut with a quiet thud, and Geroh fastened all six locks again before turning his attention on us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Please, uh, have a seat."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt proceeded to sit on the sofa and I followed suit. Geroh plopped down in one of the chairs and continued to stare suspiciously at me, his narrowed eyes flicking over my gear while his stubby fingers tapped a slow, rhythmic beat on the armrest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So, uh, who's your girlfriend? Don't think I ever seen her before."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Wha? She's not my girlfriend! I mean she's a friend, but we aren't together, or anything like that!" Ratt answered in a rush, a tinge of red burning in his cheeks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hehe sure sure, kid. Why is she here then?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Her name is Link, and she's uhhh... an emissary for the Gorons up north. They aren't happy, Geroh. They know you have their child, so they sent her to reason with you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Geroh’s brow furrowed deeper. Then his eyes widened, and his posture stiffened as a flash of alarm crossed his face. I could see the moment his confidence faltered, like a mask slipping—revealing the glint of fear behind his bluster. His fingers twitched slightly on the armrest, the bravado draining from him as his growing suspicion gave way to defensive fear.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Whoa whoa, I never stole no kid! In fact, I only bought him so's I could get him back to the Gorons all quicklike!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I decided to play along with Ratt's ploy, and spoke in a more authoritative voice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"You're lucky that they sent me ahead of them for a diplomatic solution. A preemptive strike force is waiting just outside of town right now. If I were you, I'd hand the boy over immediately so I can return him."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"OK OK, you don't have to threaten me any more lady! I'll go get him, he's probably still sleeping like a lil' boulder. Gimme a sec. You come with me, kid, I'll need a hand hauling him out. Oh and if yer girlfriend and her sprite steal anything, I'm charging Mutoh double for anything she takes, yeah?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The pudgy shopkeeper hoisted himself up and retreated to the back door, the heavy clinking of a large ring packed with keys of all shapes echoing through the room as the metal glinted faintly in the flickering candlelight. Ratt followed and disappeared through the doorway after Geroh freed the three locks guarding it, then the door closed with a heavy, metallic clang behind them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ok...so what's the plan here? We get this Goron kid back to his parents, convince them to help us up the mountain, then what? We aren't taking Ratt with us, are we?" Tatl spoke up, lightly landing on my shoulder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"My guess is that we'll figure it out as we go. And no, we've already put him through enough danger. I'll just have to convince him to stay in town somehow."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Good luck, he seems bent on following you like a lost puppy. Pretty sure he likes you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No he doesn't. He knows I'm a man—at least, I think he does.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6 c8">Unless... maybe he doesn't?</span>
      <span class="c2"> The thought sent a ripple of unease through me, and I quickly pushed it down. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">“He just wants to know how to wield a sword. That's all that's between us."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Pfft. I bet he does…" Tatl mumbled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I didn't have a chance to retort as the vault door swiftly opened, followed by Ratt and Geroh rolling a wooden barrel filled with what sounded like heavy stones. The shopkeep waved for me to come look and I stood to oblige him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Lookee here, there's your lost Goron."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Sure enough, I peered inside to find a smallish Goron child quietly snoring, seemingly unaware of his situation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"How long has he been sleeping?" I asked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ever since I got 'im. Sako- er, I mean, the one who brung him said the kid was asleep when he found the hefty boy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"That's a bit odd, but at least he's here. The Goron's fury will be sated, I'm sure." I replied officiously, taking note of Geroh's slip.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Good, them's the last thing I need jumping down my throat."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Whoa whoa whoa! That's great and all, but how do we wake him up?" Tatl interjected.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"That I do not know." Geroh shrugged. "I tried all sorts of stuff, no luck. I dunno how anything can sleep in a barrel like that. I just figgered you'd know a trick, being ...ah...emissaries and all."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmm...I could try something." I replied, the Song of Healing coming to mind. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I retrieved the Ocarina from beneath the cloak and brought it to my lips. Ratt seemed confused and inched closer to my side, probably worried that we'd be whisked through the timestream again. I gave him a reassuring pat on the shoulder and began the mystical tune, hoping it would wake the snoozing Goron. The soft notes swam around the room like graceful swans in a tranquil lake, their echoes lingering in the stillness—but when I was finished, the child continued to sleep. A flicker of frustration stirred in my chest, the silence that followed pressing heavier than before.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Well… that was certainly something. Instead of waking 'im up you probably made him even more sleepy. I know it did for me, heh heh." Geroh yawned in mock exhaustion, stretching his arms overhead with an exaggerated groan and giving his belly a lazy scratch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"It was worth a shot, Link." Ratt consoled as I rolled my eyes at the dealer. "He's a heavy one though, how can we get him to his kind? Do you have a cart or something, Geroh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Eh, I s'pose I could lend ya a pushcart or somethin'. But uh…. not fer free. I’ll trade ya, how about that shiny pendant yer wearin’?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The dealer pointed to my chest and I looked down, seeing the pendant Kotake had given me a few days ago glinting in the soft light. It was a strange charm—a smooth grey stone cool to the touch, faintly humming as if alive. A tiny, blood-red ruby gleamed at its center, surrounded by flecks of deep purple that shimmered like ink in water. A looped piece of thread was securely wrapped around it, forming a necklace. It had always pulsed faintly against my chest, like it was drinking in the air around us. Kotake had given it to me as a shield against Odalwa’s tracking—something to mask my presence, to keep the monster from sensing me through the mists. I remembered how it had comforted me in the worst parts of the swamp, a quiet talisman that made me feel less exposed, less hunted. Letting it go felt like peeling off a layer of protection I didn’t know I still needed. But with him defeated, its purpose had faded into the past.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">“That’s a fair trade I suppose, here.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I undid the leather knot and handed the medallion to Geroh, and he looked it over carefully. With a nod of satisfaction, happy to feel the quality of the stone and craftsmanship, he started towards the front door.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">“Alrighty, fair’s fair. You all stay put, I’ll go get that cart ready fer youse."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Geroh unlocked the front door again and walked out, leaving the Goron with us.I sat down on the dusty wooden floor and leaned back on the barrel. Tatl flew into the barrel with the child and Ratt plopped down beside me to sit cross-legged, kicking up a tiny poof of dust.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"See? Told you he was trustworthy. The kid’ll be back with his people in no time, and then they’ll bring us to the mountains. With luck, we’ll be there tonight!" Ratt grinned, his voice brimming with pride like he’d somehow arranged the whole thing himself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ratt, you know you can't come with us up there. It's dangerous, I told you that," I reminded sternly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah, you wouldn't last two seconds… actually probably less," Tatl added, echoing inside the barrel with a tone that stung more than it needed to.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"But I thought you were going to train me?" Ratt’s voice faltered slightly, more uncertain than defiant. He picked at a loose thread on his sleeve, not meeting my eyes. "I just... I thought maybe I could finally be more than what I was."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I can't train you and look after you. What if I'm fighting a monster and you get in the way?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt put a hand on my knee, hesitant but hopeful. A warm rush stirred in my chest—confusing, unexpected. I glanced away quickly, pretending to brush a stray speck from my tunic, willing the heat in my face to settle. It felt like keese swarming in my gut, an anxious flutter I didn’t want to name.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'll be fine," he said softly. "I've survived practically all my life on these streets. I know how to hide, how to run away… but for once in my life, after seeing you, I want to learn how to fight back."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I swallowed. Why does that look shake me? A heartbeat later, I suppressed the fluttering sensation and gently pushed Ratt’s hand away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I don't want to be responsible for your death, even if you do know how to run and hide."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What if you end up almost dying? Like last time? You might need my help again," Ratt retorted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"That's what he's got me for, genius," Tatl interrupted, flitting out from the barrel to stand on my other knee. "We're both grateful for what you did last night, but this is our adventure, our lives on the line. It's just better if you stay out of our way."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt’s grin faded. He drew his hand back into his lap, his eyes darting briefly to the floor as his shoulders slumped. The vulnerability he’d let show was quickly tucked away, replaced by a colder mask of indifference—but it was thinner now, fraying at the edges.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A pang of guilt crept into my chest, quiet but persistent—I hadn’t meant to hurt him, only to protect him, but the line between the two was blurring. A trace of disappointment lingered in the downturn of his mouth, like a question left unanswered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So, you aren't going to train me then?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No... I didn't say that."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Then when? How can I learn if I'm stuck here?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I sighed, then looked around the room. There was a large amount of empty space between the boxes and the centerpiece furniture. Plenty of room for a bit of light sparring. I stood to my feet, causing Tatl to take off, and held my hand out to Ratt to pick him up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"How about now?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt looked up, took my hand with a smile, and nodded eagerly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No time like the present."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">He pulled himself up, his grip warm and sure, and I guided him away from the barrel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"OK, first things first: your stance. There's a defensive stance and an offensive one. I'll show you defensive first."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I planted my feet shoulder-width apart, my stronger left leg slightly behind the right. Ratt mirrored me instantly, eyes focused.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yep, that's right—if you're left-handed. Are you?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh, no I'm not. Should I swap feet?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yes. And when you do, shift your weight just behind your toes. That way, you’ll be quicker on your feet. And keep your shoulders square to your opponent."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt nodded and adjusted accordingly, furrowing his brow with intent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Now, put your hands up to defend your face, but keep a loose fist."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">He raised his hands, though slightly off-center. I stepped in to correct him, guiding his arms gently. His messy black hair fell into his eyes, which glimmered with nervous excitement. The eager way he held himself made something flutter in my chest again—protective instinct, maybe... or something else… I pushed the feeling down again, more aggressively this time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">His oversized blue shirt and trousers sagged slightly on his lean frame, making him look more like a kid dressing up to play hero than a fighter in training. Still, he grinned at me with wide-eyed resolve, like a puppy ready to chase a stick. Ratt’s shaggy black hair making him look even more playful.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Alright, looking good," I said, smiling despite myself. "Now try to look a bit more... tough."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt furrowed his brow and curled his lip into a little snarl—a valiant effort.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Now, I'm going to punch at your right side. Sidestep left with your right foot, and grab my arm to block. Got it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Got it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I lunged with a light jab. Ratt flinched, late to react, and my fist tapped his ribs. He still managed to grab my arm in time, completing the move—if clumsily.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I wasn't ready for that," he said with a sheepish grin, rubbing the spot. "But did I do it right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Not quite," I said, chuckling softly. "But you're getting there. We’ll get it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">His grin returned, wide and earnest, and I could see how badly he wanted this—wanted to be something more than just the scrappy street kid. And in that look, for just a heartbeat, I felt the flicker of something warmer, messier, and much harder to ignore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">As I shifted to show him the next position, a sudden clink rang out beside us—the Hero’s Mask had slipped from my belt and tumbled to the wooden floor, landing face-up between us. I froze.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt stooped instinctively to pick it up. "Whoa, I probably knocked that off, sorry—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The moment his fingers touched the mask, a jolt of magic surged between them both. A flash of golden light burst from the carved eyes, and Ratt recoiled with a sharp gasp, yelping as if burned. The mask thudded back to the floor, its edges still humming faintly, a whisper of energy curling into the air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">“Wh-what was that? What just happened?” Ratt stared in wide-eyed horror at the mask, clutching the hand that had touched it. His fingers trembled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">“I… don’t know. I’ve never seen it do that before,” I said, crouching quickly to retrieve it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">But Ratt didn’t move. He kept staring at his hand, dazed. “I… I saw something. Just for a second. A castle. It was… it was raining. And I heard a girl’s voice. She was calling out—calling your name. I think she was crying.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">My heart tightened, though I didn’t know why. “You heard someone calling me?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">He nodded faintly, eyes distant. “Yeah… I didn’t recognize her. But it felt... important. Like she was in trouble.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I crouched and picked up the mask again. The carved face was still warm beneath my fingers, as if it had absorbed the heat of that moment. A hollow weight settled in my chest. Whoever Ratt saw—whoever she was—I knew that voice once. I was sure of it. But the memory was locked away, just out of reach.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt rubbed his palm again and looked at me. “It didn’t feel like just a vision. It felt like… like I was supposed to hear her.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I met his eyes and gave a slow nod, more for his sake than mine. “I'm sure it was just a weird residual effect of the magic in this mask...” I said, though I wasn’t sure what it meant.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Still, as I strapped my Hero’s Mask firmly back onto my belt, I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something important that I was forgetting. What was that voice he heard? Who did it belong to?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I glanced at Ratt, who was still staring at the floor, his brows furrowed in confusion and wonder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">“Are you okay?” I asked softly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">“I think so,” he murmured, blinking as if waking from a dream. “That was just... a weird feeling is all.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I pulled my lips into a tight smile as I brushed some dust off my former, familiar features etched in the wood and strapped the mask firmly back onto my belt. My hands lingered there a moment longer than necessary.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">“Well, whatever it was, we’ll figure it out later. Let’s continue where we left off, if you still want to keep going…?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt nodded and shook himself out of the daze, taking position again. We resumed the motions—I would strike, and he would take my arm. Slowly but surely, he began to get the hang of it. When he nearly perfected the maneuver, I saw a hopeful gleam in his eyes. That spark of determination again, catching fire. I couldn't help but grin back at him as he held my arm in a secure grip.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Just then the heavy door swung open with Geroh loudly grunting. One look at us and he shook his head with a knowing smile.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">“Oh don’t let me interrupt! I see the two of ya are learnin’ some smooth moves, eh? Hahahah!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt flinched and let go of my arm at once, the motion sharp and sheepish. A rush of heat crept up my neck, and I suddenly found the floorboards terribly interesting, cheeks flushing with a bashful red as Geroh’s gaze swept the room. I straightened quickly, brushing imaginary dust from my gloves, trying to recover a sense of composure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Anyways, I got that cart all ready for youse guys. Just, uh, return it when you're done, kid," he said with a wink. "Here, I'll help ya move this thing onto it, free o’ charge. The emissary and her fairy can wait outside, youse both watch the cart, eh? Don’t want no one takin’ off with it. This part of town ain’t, uh… exactly peaches and cream, ya know?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I was all too eager to walk out of the building with Tatl hovering beside me, the warm glow of the morning sun brushing my face like a balm. Just outside the door stood a large pushcart with four thick wooden wheels. It looked sturdy enough—probably used for hauling crates, barrels, or whatever other illicit goods Geroh dealt in when fewer eyes were watching.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">“Sooo how was your little training session?” Tatl suddenly cut in, sarcasm dripping from her tiny mouth. “I saw the whole thing hehe. You sure you wouldn’t rather stay in town and pick flowers for him? Maybe go on a romantic getaway before the apocalypse?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">“What are you talking about? He just wanted to learn how to fight.” I shot a glare at her, hating that she saw more than I wanted to show. “Look, you know as well as I do that he won’t survive with those pirates looking for him. He needs to know how to defend himself.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">“Riiiight, so all that blushing was just for defense, huh? I saw the way you two looked at each other. You’re practically glowing.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">“I was not blushing,” I muttered, far too quickly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">“Sure you weren’t,” Tatl giggled, doing an exaggerated spin midair. "Just sayin’, he might not be the only one who needs a little protection if you catch my drift.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I was about to shoot back something sharp when a loud laugh erupted from within the shop, followed by the heavy thuds of wood and metal scraping across the floor. Geroh emerged, pushing the barrel ahead with a grunt, and Ratt right behind him—his face crimson, eyes locked on the ground as if hoping it might swallow him whole.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Whatever Geroh had said during their short walk, he was clearly proud of it. The man was still chuckling, nudging the barrel into place on the cart with a final shove. Ratt barely glanced up as he moved behind the cart to steady it, his cheeks still glowing, and not from exertion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Alright, kid, be sure to bring that thing back. And don't get into too much trouble, yeah?" Geroh called out, casting me another wink.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Ratt rubbed the back of his neck and muttered something under his breath, eyes darting to the side with a sheepish smile that vanished almost as quickly as it appeared. He glanced off toward the cart as though its wooden frame held the answers to his embarrassment. I caught that flicker of warmth before he buried it, and I scowled grumpily. There was no way I was going to fall for this scrappy kid. What was I even thinking?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">My chest tightened with something sharp and unwelcome. It was infuriating—how easily that dumb grin could undo me. I hated that my thoughts even flickered that way, hated how they made me feel softer, smaller... like the girl everyone kept assuming I was. Like something delicate instead of dangerous. This wasn’t me. I wasn’t here to smile and blush and wonder what someone thought of me. I was here to fight. To fix what was broken.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Don't worry, we've been in enough trouble," I stated, the edge in my voice harder than I meant it to be.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ha! I bet you have..." The stocky shopkeep looked me up and down and laughed before walking back inside. "Good luck, and thanks for taking that kid off my hands."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The door shut with a heavy thud and the locks clicked into place. Ratt seemed eager to be moving on, so I moved to his side to help him push the heavy cart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Ready?" I grunted with a shove of the cart. "We're going to the north side, that's where the Gorons said they'd be last time."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Uhh yeah, that's fine. We'll have to take the main streets though."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Oh great…It'll take all day to get there!" Tatl groaned. "Why do we have to keep dealing with these tourists?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">We both ignored the fairy and began pushing the cart. The wooden wheels creaked forward with surprising ease, and we rolled into the now-crowded streets, swallowed by the mingled scents of roasted nuts, animal dung, and overripe fruit. Shouts and laughter tangled with the clatter of hooves and jingling coin purses, the noise washing over us in chaotic waves. The going was agonizingly slow, and grew ever slower as the day progressed. The cacophony of a thousand conversations, not to mention the constant juggling of people bumping into us, made me wonder how the heavy Goron child could possibly be sleeping through the trip. However, we eventually made it to the much quieter northern park as the sun lingered above the western horizon, the trees casting long shadows over the area. Both Ratt and I were gasping for breath and I wished I had used my mask for extra strength. A flicker of stubborn pride kept me from reaching for it earlier, but now that pride felt a little foolish in the face of my aching muscles and burning lungs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Tatl sat on top of the cart, throwing tiny pebbles she had gathered from the road into the barrel out of boredom. Yet we finally reached the north gate after a grueling journey. The guard posted at the gate looked rather disheveled and banged up with dents the size of a small dog in his chest plate armor, a sight that made me pause—was he brave for still standing, or just too stubborn to know when to retreat? and accosted us before we could get through.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"H-hey! Where are you kids going? Haven't you heard? Monsters are everywhere outside of town!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah, but we have important cargo to deliver. If you don't let us through then people could die!" Ratt rushed to explain, stretching the truth mildly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Right. Well then you wouldn't mind me checking this cargo…" The guard immediately peeked inside the barrel and suddenly leapt back in fearful surprise.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"T-that's the baby Goron! What a-are you doing with it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"We're taking him back to his people, you better let us through before things get any worse." I calmly explained between heavy breaths.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Huh? How did you…? Gods what am I doing? Go go go! Get that thing out of town! I'm not gonna stop you, I learned my lesson when I tried holding back the other Gorons this morning!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The guard rushed to join us behind the cart and began to frantically push it out the gate. We joined him in forcing the cart just beyond the gate, and the guard gave one last oomph and pointed in the direction of a plume of black smoke coming from a copse of trees as he walked back inside the gate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"The other Gorons made camp over there, but I recommend you just drop the cart off right at the first tree and run back. Those Gorons aren't as friendly as the old stories say they are. The really big guy almost killed me this morning!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I think we'll be fine, thanks." I waved back as we continued to shove the cart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The cowardly guard muttered something rude under his breath about dumb kids deserving death. I rolled my eyes but bit my tongue—no use wasting breath on someone who'd already lost face to a pack of angry Gorons.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"OK...almost there you two...ungh!" </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Yeah. Almost. My legs feel like chu jelly…" Ratt huffed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Speak for yourself! I'm so bored I might just fly off and fight those monsters myself—and honestly, I’d probably get there faster than you two." came a high-pitched voice dripping with sarcasm from within the barrel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The little white pixie leapt onto the rim of the cart and stretched languidly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">"At least we're almost there—though I was starting to wonder if you'd be pushing this thing all the way into tomorrow. Seriously, Link, ever heard of using your magic mask for something </span>
      <span class="c6 c8">useful</span>
      <span class="c2">? Or are you saving it for dramatic effect? You'd be much stronger with it on."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I don't...need it, Tatl. I can push it just fine." I puffed, "Why don't...urgh... you just enjoy the free ride?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">In truth I just didn't want to deal with the pain of transformation, my body had been through enough for one day. Besides...finding a hiding spot to change would just take more time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Eh, suit yourself. I'm actually enjoying myself!" Tatl shrugged and jumped back into the barrel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The sky grew dark as the sun dipped beneath the skyline, and crickets began to chirp peacefully as the cart rumbled slowly to the trees.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c20">
      <span class="c2">
        <br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The sweet evening air filled my heaving lungs, mixed with the mildly spicy scent of pine needles—a strangely calming aroma that settled my nerves, reminding me for a fleeting moment of my old home in the Kokiri Woods. The sounds of faint, forlorn chanting could be heard within the grove as well rumbled past the first trees. A bright warm glow hinted at a large bonfire burning in the woods and the rhythmic vocal tones grew louder the further we went.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The cart suddenly creaked loudly and a crack could be heard from one of the wheels. The heavy barrel slid off the frame with a deafening crash with a tiny squeak sounding from inside it as the right wheel essentially splintered to pieces. The melancholy voices immediately turned to angry bellows as what sounded like a rock avalanche thundered towards us. My breath caught in my throat, instincts screaming to run—but I held my ground, heart hammering, hands twitching toward my satchel out of habit. This wasn't a battle I wanted, but I would be ready if it became one.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"What the…! Intruders? Thieves? Don't let them escape!" A deep, authoritative voice boomed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I rushed to the barrel to try dumping the slumbering Goron to show that I came in peace. The kid plunked onto the ground just in time as three massive Gorons crashed through the branches, surrounding us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"State your business or else, humans!" One of the stoney giants bellowed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Brothers! I bring you good news!" I bellowed up at him in turn. "We found your stolen child! We have brought him back to you in a show of good faith!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I gestured to the ever-sleeping child and the speaker lumbered over to him in shock.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"How… did you know we were looking for him?" He asked with an astounded expression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"It's a long story… but the important thing is that he's here, and safe."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Hmph. Were it my judgment alone, I'd grind you into gravel where you stand. Humans lie with honeyed tongues and take what is not theirs. But the chief alone will decide your fate. Move—before I change my mind."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The speaker hoisted the child into his arms and walked back towards the fire while the other two motioned us to follow him. The sharp tang of smoke and crushed herbs thickened the air as we stepped deeper into the grove, and the weight of a dozen silent stares prickled along the back of my neck. A large bonfire, with flames reaching at least five meters into the air, sat at the center of the clearing. Several Gorons were crowded around something near the fire, an altar maybe, only briefly looking at us before continuing their melodic chanting and waving herbs through the air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A very ancient, haggard Goron slowly ambled with a stone cane over to the leader with the child from a spot looking over the huddled group. The smaller elder exchanged quick words with the younger in hushed tones, the two of them likely trying to decide on if we were a threat or not. A few minutes later, an agreement was apparently reached and the elder goron looked to us. He walked towards us with his painfully thin legs visibly shaking beneath his massively bulbous body, but he didn't falter. The ancient chieftain's hunched shoulders appeared as if they bore a thousand problems, and the deep cracks in his face creased in thought as the elder looked us over. I stood a little straighter under his gaze, feeling as if my every secret might be drawn out and judged. Something about him made my palms itch with unease, like I was a child again standing before the Deku Tree after doing something wrong. The younger Goron carrying the child was much taller physically than the elder, but the chieftain carried himself in such a way that demanded respect. After looking at me with faded blue eyes, he finally spoke in a frail, whispy voice before reaching into a pouch to withdraw a lens in the shape of an eye.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"So… no matter who or what you say you are. “We will find out the truth. And if we do not like what we see… you and your friend will die."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">My stomach tightened, a cold knot twisting behind my ribs. I instinctively shifted my weight, one hand brushing near my satchel where the mask waited—familiar, dangerous, reassuring. I kept my face calm, but the Elder Goron's eyes made me feel exposed, as though even my heartbeat might betray me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c20">

    </p>
    <h1 class="c35" id="h.4log3qct80fq">
      <span>The Stone Warrior</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c15">
      <span class="c9 c16 c8 c43"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The bonfire’s light cast long, flickering shadows across the twilit grove, turning the moss-covered stones and gnarled roots into shapes that felt older than memory. Two Goron guards flanked me, their grips like iron clamps on my shoulders—unyielding, unshakable. I didn’t struggle. I knew better. Every inch of my body warned me that a single twitch could lead to shattered bones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Around us, a low chorus of deep voices rumbled in the dusk: chanting, humming, something between mourning and ritual. I couldn’t see the source, but I felt the weight of it, vibrating softly through the earth beneath my boots. The ground thrummed with sorrow—slow, steady pulses like the heartbeat of something ancient and grieving. It was as if the very mountain remembered every loss ever suffered, and was mourning anew.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Each vibration carried something deeper than sound—grief, longing, a quiet despair that seeped up through the soles of my feet and wrapped itself around my chest. It wasn’t just the air that was heavy—it was the feeling of losing something precious.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I couldn't help but feel an oppressive sadness tighten around my own emotions, sinking into me like cold water.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">But I didn't dare move to see what was happening, for fear of my bones being crushed with just a simple gesture from one of the massive hands keeping me still. The elder Goron, who I assumed was the leader of the tribe, slowly approached with a strange, yet somehow familiar, lens held in his gnarled, stony hands. The artifact shimmered faintly in the firelight, and it reminded me of something I had found in my past...but I couldn't place it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">
        Most of the Gorons I could see in the camp, younger and heartier, stood a meter or more above my height—yet the hunched elder's faded blue eyes were level with mine. Almost face to face now, he studied me with a weathered intensity that made my skin prickle.
        <br/>
        Tatl hovered silently near my shoulder, unusually quiet. I could feel the tremble in her wings—not from fear, but from something deeper. She was feeling it too: the strange pull of sorrow that had thickened the very air here.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Then, with great care, he raised the lens between us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">It was definitely familiar... but also unlike anything I had ever seen. The frame was forged of dark volcanic iron, warped and weathered with age, wrapped in threads of silver that glinted like frost under the firelight. At its center pulsed a deep crimson gem, shaped like a watchful eye, its surface alive with shifting light. Runes spiraled along the metal edge—ancient script that shimmered faintly as if reacting to the presence of magic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">When he looked through it, the world felt like it was bending around me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">My own reflection shimmered in the gem—no, not just shimmered. It changed. Something beneath the surface stared back at me: not quite my face, not quite a stranger. The air grew heavier, and for a fleeting second I felt exposed—not just seen, but known.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Boromu's brow furrowed further, the lens trembling slightly in his grip. He lowered it slowly, as if reluctant, then cast a glance down my frame, pausing as if confirming something. Then he raised the glass eye again, the gem flashing with internal light.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Curious... in all my years I've never seen such...."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">His gravelly voice trailed off into muttering, thick with wonder and unease. He slipped the lens into his sash with a reverence usually reserved for sacred relics, his sagging lips twisting into a strange pout.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Elder Boromu, what is it? What did you see?" one of the guards asked reverently, clearly surprised.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"This human... there is a strange conflict within them. Two souls shifting back and forth between this one, and a warrior male garbed in green. How could this be?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The elder came closer, and I caught the heavy stench of sulfur on his breath. I tried not to gag as he came within an inch of me, inspecting me with a gnarled finger pointed at my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"I'm not... from around here. My name is Link. I came from a land called Hyrule. I was riding my horse through the forest when I was suddenly ambushed by a Skull Kid wearing a strange mask. I tried to fight, but ended up getting cursed into... well, what you see now."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">When I mentioned Hyrule, the Gorons holding me notably stirred. Boromu merely gazed on with those old, weary eyes.... but he looked away at the mention of Skull Kid, giving me a moment to breathe freely. But when he turned back, something in his expression had hardened.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Skull Kid... yes, I am familiar with his violent tricks. He came to our village days ago and demanded we serve him. I refused... and we've been suffering since. An eternal winter has fallen on our beloved mountains. Where there should be summer warmth, there are now blizzards and ice. We believe he tampered with our Divine Beast—a relic of a bygone era that controls weather."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">He paused, his gaze narrowing as he studied me anew.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"And you say you came from Hyrule..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">There was a note of unease in his voice. He turned slightly away, as if grappling with memory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Our ancestors fled Hyrule long ago, seeking peace. That land was torn by chaos—wars, gods walking as men, men playing at gods. It was a place where stone cracked and rivers ran backwards. Many still speak its name only in whispers. That you survived such a place at all is... remarkable."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Boromu looked to the chanting circle, where the earth softly rumbled outward. The scent of scorched pine lingered faintly in the cold air, curling around the flickering shadows like smoke from a distant fire.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Our greatest warrior, Darmani, went to confront the Skull Kid at Snowhead Temple, where we commune with the Beast. He sought to calm Goht and end this unnatural winter... but alas, he has met a terrible fate. I tell you this only because the lens does not lie. And according to the lens, you are trustworthy—however strange your cursed soul may be."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">His eyes drifted back to me with a forlorn expression, his lips twisted into a mournful curl. The firelight etched deep lines into his stone face, and the weight of memory seemed to sag from his shoulders.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Darmani, our last hope, is dying. Slowly turning to stone and crumbling under a curse. Our priests cannot undo it; the magic is too strong. We came to Clock Town seeking help, thinking the humans might have strong remedies... but they proved to be treacherous thieves. They stole my son, for reasons I still do not understand. Their ways are strange to us. They value gold over honor. Material over Spirit."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The wind shifted, carrying with it the scent of pine smoke and crushed herbs. The chanting in the distance deepened, as if the grove itself leaned in to listen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Boromu's old, faded eyes locked on mine, and I felt like my entire soul was laid bare beneath them—past, future, and everything in between.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"And yet, you, a soul conflicted by curses as well, who came from the war torn land of the ancients... returned him to me. I must ask, and you will answer truthfully... why?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I hesitated. For a heartbeat, the question echoed through me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Because it was the right thing to do? Because I wanted to protect something? Because I couldn't save myself?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">But all I said was:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Because no one else would."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Boromu studied me for a long moment. Then he nodded once, slowly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Come. You will see Darmani. If the gods have placed you on our path, we shall follow it to the end."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The elder motioned with a wave of his hand, and the others released their vice-like grip on my shoulders. I rolled them back with a wince, only now realizing how tight their hands had been against my narrower build. The ache lingered like phantom bruises.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Boromu began his slow shuffle toward the chanting circle, and I followed close behind. The vibration grew stronger with each step, resonating through my boots and up into my spine. Yet the chants did not grow louder. It was as if the Gorons were no longer speaking to each other, but to the mountain itself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Then, all at once, the chanting stopped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The silence was absolute. Even the wind seemed to still. For a breathless moment, the grove felt like the eye of a storm—expectant, reverent, unnerving. The Ocarina in my satchel pressed gently against my hip, warm and faintly pulsing, as if aware of what was to come.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">When we reached the edge of the circle, the assembled Gorons stepped aside in solemn unison. I crossed the boundary, and the earth gave a soft groan beneath my feet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">At the center of the circle lay a massive Goron, unmoving. His form stretched long and broad, his bulk weathered by snow and time. He was so still, he could have been a sculpture—but he was no work of art. This was a body resisting death with every grain of stone. Most of his skin had turned to a dark, mottled grey, fractured like cooling lava. Only a few patches of the original russet-gold peered through near the joints and chest. Tiny flakes of crumbling dust fell from his shoulders with each subtle tremor in the ground.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">His face was locked in an expression of grim defiance—or was it pain? I couldn’t tell. Not until I stood before him did I realize how large he truly was. Even lying down, he towered over me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The scent of burning pine and smoked sage still lingered in the air, curling low like ghosts around the stone circle. Clay pots of incense had been arranged with care near the giant's head, their embers glowing faintly as they sent delicate ribbons of smoke drifting through the cool breeze. The fragrances mixed with the earthy tang of moss and fire-kissed stone, creating a quiet sacredness that clung to the skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Boromu raised one arm slowly and gestured toward the fallen warrior.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"If you truly believe that you can help us, do so now."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">My thoughts went to the Ocarina resting in my belt pouch, and I gingerly pulled it free, feeling the smooth, cool material against my fingertips. It pulsed faintly with memory. Tatl, uncharacteristically quiet, hovered near my shoulder, her wings a faint glimmer in the dusk. She said nothing, but her silence was weightier than words. When I brought the Ocarina to my lips, she floated back and gave me space—a rare, reverent stillness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I knew what I had to do.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The notes of the Song of Healing flowed out in quiet ripples, soft and mournful. The melody hung in the grove like mist, echoing between the trees and the hearts of those gathered. Not a whisper could be heard. Even the fire seemed to bow to the music, its flames stilling just slightly with each note.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">

      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">When the last note faded into silence, nothing happened at first.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The Gorons glanced around, unsure. The quiet felt heavier now, expectant. Then, a thin crack of light shimmered along the fault lines in Darmani's petrified skin—subtle, but unmistakable. Gasps rippled through the circle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">As if summoned by the song, the stone began to loosen. It crumbled and flaked away like old bark shedding from a tree, revealing the golden-brown hue of Goron flesh beneath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The circle held its breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Darmani twitched. Barely. Then again. A finger curled. A massive chest lifted in a shallow breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">And then, as if released by some ancient spell, the crowd exhaled in unison as the fallen warrior began to breathe again on his own.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Darmani opened his eyes, slowly, as the last of the stone crumbled away. Tatl drew close to me and with a relieved smile, released a held breath of her own.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Link... you did it! The song worked this time!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The Elder Goron's throat grumbled in relief, staggering up to Darmani's head. With a gnarled hand, Boromu brushed debris off the giant's face, smiling with a mouth that had hardly any teeth left.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Darmani... what a gift this child has brought us. We are saved!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">But the moment shattered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The giant opened his mouth as if to speak, but suddenly he gasped in pain, clutching at his side with a ragged, rattling breath. The sound was wrong—wet, labored, desperate. Boromu's smile froze and fell away as he looked where Darmani was grasping. His eyes, so recently bright with hope, turned to dread.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I followed his gaze.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Where once there had been only stone, now there was a deep, open gash. Blood, thick and dark blue, welled from it in sickening pulses, spilling across the mossy earth like ink from a cracked vessel. It soaked into the soil, steaming faintly in the cool air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No... no no no," Tatl murmured beside me, her wings dimming, her voice shaking. "That wasn’t supposed to happen. He was supposed to be okay!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Boromu waved his cane at the circle, barking orders, calling for herbs, a dressing, anything to stop the flow. Gorons rushed forward with armfuls of green-smoked leaves and thick bandages, their heavy steps thudding desperately through the soil. But I knew. I could see it in Darmani's eyes—glassy, unfocused, already beginning to slip.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I knelt beside him, barely breathing, and raised the Ocarina again with trembling fingers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"Please," I whispered, as much to the gods as to the instrument. "Not this. Heal him! Please...!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I desperately brought the instrument to my lips again. The Song of Healing spilled out once more, trembling and raw. My breath hitched with every note, my hands unsteady, tears stinging behind my eyes. The song was slower this time—not a melody, but a plea. I played it again, and again... but nothing answered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Around us, the circle of Gorons fell into a mournful silence, their expressions stunned and helpless. Some had fallen to their knees. Others covered their faces with thick hands. Even the fire seemed to dim.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">But even before the final note echoed into silence, I felt it. The stillness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Darmani exhaled one last time. A soft glow began to rise from his chest, pale and golden. The wind caught it, swirling the light upward as the massive form of the warrior began to dissolve, fragment by fragment, into shimmering dust. Darmani's eyes looked up at Boromu with a deep sadness—a sense of failure, of hopelessness—resonated from them. His lips parted, as if to speak, but no words came. Only a shuddering breath. And then... the light in his eyes faded, like coals cooling in a hearth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">"No..." I choked, my voice breaking.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I reached out without thinking, as if I could hold him here a moment longer — catch the light before it slipped away. My fingers brushed through warmth, through dust and radiance—until they met something solid. The sensation jarred me: not the hot, living skin of a warrior reborn, but the cool, resolute edge of carved stone. My hand, trembling, rested not on Darmani’s chest, but something else.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The light swallowed him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Within seconds, only a faint outline of his body remained—and then, nothing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">Nothing but a single object remained, cradled beneath my trembling hand—resting gently where his heart had been.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">A mask.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">It bore Darmani's likeness in stone: solemn, strong, unyielding. The features were carved with grace and power, frozen mid-roar, like a silent monument to a warrior who had fought to the very end.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">I curled my fingers around it, lifting it into my hands. The weight was immense—far heavier than its size should allow. The stone was still warm, as if holding the last breath of the one who had worn it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">One of the younger Gorons let out a choked sob and fell to his knees, pounding the earth in rhythmic grief. Another tore fistfuls of dirt from the ground and pressed them against his brow, weeping openly. An older Goron sank to his haunches and began to sing, low and broken—a mourning song that trembled through the grove like the dying echoes of a bell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2">The silence was no longer reverent — it was hollow, raw, and vibrating with everything they had just lost. I took up the mask and held it close, its edges rough beneath my fingers, its weight deeper than stone. I didn’t know if I had just been given a weapon, a grave marker, or the burden of a dying warrior’s final wish. But I could feel it—etched into the stone, humming against my chest—that this was not the end. It was a beginning. And it wasn’t mine alone.</span>

      <span class="c18 c9 c16 c8">The Mask of the Mountain</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">At first, there was nothing but silence. Even the roaring fire seemed to silence itself, feeling muffled in the heavy air. And then, a single snowflake fell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Just one, drifting quietly from the darkened sky above the grove, landing without ceremony on the back of my hand. It clung there for a heartbeat—fragile, precise—before vanishing into my skin like a breath forgotten. Then another. And another.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Within moments, the first snows had begun.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">It wasn’t fierce. Not yet. It was gentle, almost reverent, as though the mountain itself was bowing its head to grieve. The embers of the sacred fire crackled softly behind me, casting a fading warmth on my back. Around the circle, the Gorons remained kneeling or standing in stunned silence, their broad forms hunched beneath the weight of the moment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Darmani was gone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">And in his place, I held a mask. As I stared at the mask, a tight knot of guilt twisted deeper into my chest. Darmani’s bravery left an echo in the air—reminding me uncomfortably of all the things I had failed to protect, all the lives slipping through my fingers like sand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I hadn’t moved in what felt like hours. My hands still cradled the carved stone, rough and warm with lingering spirit. It didn’t feel like a mask. It felt like a heart carved hollow, still echoing the last breath of its owner.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">A few snowflakes had settled on my head, melting immediately. The cold bearing down as if Darmani was the last bastion against the onslaught of winter. I let it. The cold seemed fitting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu stood nearby, his cane driven into the soft earth, his cracked eyes staring not at me, but at the hollow space where Darmani had vanished. He hadn’t said a word since.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The other Gorons were just as silent, but some of them held each other, others were broken down on the ground, faces in their hands. A young one pressed his forehead to the frozen earth, humming low and wordless. An elder had curled into himself, hands clutching smooth prayer stones etched in deep sigils, lips moving in a whisper too quiet to hear. Another Goron, broader than the rest, sat motionless with his hand outstretched toward the empty air where Darmani had disappeared, as if unwilling to believe the space was empty. Their grief filled the grove not with sound, but with presence—a pressure in the chest, a stillness in the trees, a heaviness in the snow as it began to gather.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Even Tatl seemed frozen—not from cold, but from reverence. Her wings fluttered just once as the snow began to fall, then stilled. The usual sharp glint in her voice had been smothered by the weight of what we’d witnessed.  Her glow dimmed to a pale shimmer, hovering uncertainly beside my shoulder. In that moment, even she seemed too fragile for words.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">It felt like time itself had stopped. The snow fell in slow spirals, each flake tracing its own path toward the earth like forgotten prayers. The air tasted of smoke and frost. The fire crackled behind us, brittle and subdued, casting weak shadows across the grove. No one moved. No one breathed loud enough to disturb the hush.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Until Boromu finally moved.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The elder exhaled slowly, the sound more like a landslide than a sigh. Then he turned to me—not with authority, but with something heavier. Expectation. Hope, maybe. Or resignation. The furrows in his stone face were carved deep by grief, yet something flickered there—a dim ember refusing to die.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"If you carry his mask," he said, voice rough with age and grief, "then you carry what remains of him. Whether you asked to or not."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I didn’t answer. I wasn’t sure I could. My throat was tight, my thoughts brittle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Snow began to gather in Darmani’s empty space—the last mark he’d left behind as he lay dying. It filled the depression slowly, gently, as if trying to erase the memory of his existence. But I couldn’t let it. I couldn’t look away. The swirl of snow blurred the edges of the hollow, like time trying to wash over pain too fresh to bury.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c20">
      <span class="c3"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The grief that weighed on this grove wasn’t mine alone. It clung to my shoulders, settled into my lungs, mixed with the steam of my breath. I needed space to think, to understand why I felt so connected to these Gorons—why it hurt so much to watch them break.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tears welled behind my eyes before I realized they’d been building. I turned from the fire’s last embers, retreating to the edge of the grove. There, beneath a leaning pine glazed in frost, I stopped. My hands clutched the stone Goron mask, cold and sharp like it was Darmani's resolve. Its expression—frozen in strength, carved in roar—felt like a question I couldn’t answer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The chill seeped in through my boots and into my chest, a creeping cold I couldn’t shake. Snow settled across my shoulders like quiet hands. I shivered hard, and then I felt Tatl’s glow at my shoulder—a faint pulse of warmth against the wind, like the last ember in a fading hearth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Link… are you okay?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Her voice was soft. Not teasing. Not biting. Just… worried.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I shut my eyes and looked away, jaw tight.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“I… I don’t know,” I whispered, my strength breaking. “This… this wasn’t supposed to happen. I keep losing, Tatl. I keep trying and nothing works. Ever since I left Hyrule... it’s like the gods are angry at me. Like they’re taking things away from me. One by one.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">My voice faltered, choked by the sharp sting rising in my throat. “And maybe... maybe they are. Maybe I turned my back on what I was meant to be. Maybe I abandoned the very path they gave me, and now they’ve abandoned me in return.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I could feel it, like a door had quietly closed somewhere far behind me. A divine silence. Not punishment. Not wrath. Just absence. The terrifying weight of being left alone—not by people, but by purpose.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The mask remained in my hands, unmoved. But something in its silence felt familiar. Like it knew that same emptiness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">And all I could hear was the wind whispering through the pines and the snow collecting the heavy silence like stones—patient, inevitable. It was as though the world itself had run out of answers. I stared into the mask, and the mask stared right back, almost as if in defiance to my weakness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">And then, it pulsed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">A slow, low vibration thrummed through my palms—not painful, but resonant, like a struck bell echoing through stone. The mask shimmered faintly, its eyes briefly catching the starlight. I gasped and almost dropped it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Did you feel that?" I whispered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl hovered a little closer, her glow dimming in awe. "Feel what? Are you—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">But before she could finish, the world shifted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">A rush of heat filled my chest, then my skull. The wind around us seemed to stop entirely. I blinked—and the pine forest vanished.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I was standing on a mountaintop.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Snow swirled in blistering waves around me. A horn sounded in the distance, deep and mournful. Goron voices echoed in a ritual chant, and then shattered into screams. I turned—behind me, a temple of stone and ice cracked open as a monstrous shape emerged, bound in chains of lightning and frost.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Goht.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I felt the bitter, biting cold of the mountaintop as if it were my own, tasted the coppery tang of blood from a wound I hadn't earned, and knew the grief and fury of a warrior staring down his final battle, knowing he would not survive, yet fighting all the same</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>I could feel the memory like it was </span>
      <span class="c8">mine</span>
      <span class="c3">. The cold. The fear. The duty. I was seeing through Darmani’s eyes—his final memory, left behind in the mask like a song trapped in stone. His last desperate stand. His failure. His sorrow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">And beneath it all... a plea.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The vision fell away as quickly as it had come. I staggered forward, heart hammering in my chest. The mask’s warmth faded, but the echo remained.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl hovered close again, breathless. “Was that…?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I nodded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“He wants me to finish it. He wants someone to carry it through.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The mask rested in my hands, still and heavy once more. But it no longer felt like just a relic. It felt like a bond. A burden passed through stone and time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">And I knew, whether I was ready or not—this was the path I would walk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">My fingers tightened around the stone edges. Without thinking, as if guided by something deeper than will, I lifted the mask.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Link, wait—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl’s voice didn’t reach me in time. The moment the mask touched my face, the world twisted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>A surge of heat slammed into my chest. My arms jerked backward, spine arching unnaturally as a tremendous force tore through my muscles, pulling my body outward, upward, </span>
      <span class="c8">wider</span>
      <span class="c3">. My skin split and reshaped itself in impossible ways, bones snapping and thickening, pain laced with something almost euphoric. My tunic burst at the seams. My boots cracked open. The mask fused to my face like molten iron—and then, like stone, it became me. My mind splintered under the surge of raw strength, both terrifying and exhilarating. Link—my true self—was slipping away, replaced by a powerful certainty that burned in every muscle and bone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">When I hit the ground, it cracked beneath me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>I gasped, but the sound that escaped my throat was no longer mine. It was a bass-heavy </span>
      <span class="c8">grunt</span>
      <span class="c3">, deep and gurgling like a landslide. I looked down—my arms were huge. Thick slabs of muscle covered in rough stone skin. My chest heaved, wide as a wagon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Hurr… what… happenin’…?” I mumbled. Even my voice was different—deep, guttural, and dim. My mouth wasn’t moving the way I expected. My tongue felt too big.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>"Oh… holy gods," Tatl murmured, darting around my shoulder. "You're... You're a Goron! But... wow. A </span>
      <span class="c8">huge</span>
      <span class="c3"> one."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I blinked slowly, my vision strange and heavy—like everything had slowed, just a little. My thoughts felt... distant. Sluggish. Like someone had packed cotton around my brain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I looked down at myself—at the broad, domed chest rising and falling like a boulder shifting with breath. My arms were massive, corded with muscle that looked less like flesh and more like carved basalt. My fingers ended in thick, ridged knuckles, like hammers shaped from stone. My once-loose tunic was now tattered cloth clinging awkwardly to the edges of a rocky torso, and my boots—what was left of them—had split wide to reveal massive feet ringed with stone-like ridges.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">A glowing sigil, faint but pulsing with each heartbeat, burned softly on my shoulder. My entire body radiated heat, like smoldering stone after a volcanic surge. I could feel strength in every movement, but control was slipping away, thought by thought. I was hulking. Heavy. A wall of living rock.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Somehow, it all felt familiar.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>My thoughts were thick. Like packed snow. But there was fire in my veins now. Pride. Duty. Something primal. The mask had given me this form for a reason—and I would use it. Smash ice. Protect tribe. That’s what Darmani wanted. That’s what I </span>
      <span class="c8">wanted</span>
      <span class="c3">. Right?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I notice the brothers standing behind me, looking at their hero reborn.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Elder Boromu speaks, his voice quivering with pride. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Darmani? Is that… -no, no you’re different. You wear green garb and strange armor. Are you… are you truly that human who played the melody that heals? We all felt its power… heard its wisdom. Darmani passed, but not in a way any of us thought possible in a long, long time. He gave his strength for you to borrow as gratitude for healing his spirit, through that mask. Through you… he can save us!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I felt honor and pride well up deep within my stones, my deepest hearts, and I raised a gigantic fist and roared back against the winter creeping up on us. I would be victorious! I would win! I would fight all threats that came my way! Suddenly I almost remembered what I was doing just moments before.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I turned to Tatl, confused. She hovered in silence for a moment, then groaned.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>“Oh no. Not just a Goron… You’re </span>
      <span class="c8">him</span>
      <span>. You’re Darmani. Or, uh… something very close. Just… maybe not all the way </span>
      <span class="c8">there.</span>
      <span class="c3">”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Not, Darmani…no. Link, uh..I am… Huh...?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I scratched my enormous head. My arms felt like cliffs. My hands—barely hands—were slabs of stone wrapped in muscle. Something was fuzzy. Not right. Thoughts made no sense. But I remembered that I had to smash winter! Break the ice!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Me… s’posed to smash ice now, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>Tatl buried her tiny face in her hands. “This is going to be </span>
      <span class="c8">exhausting.</span>
      <span class="c3">”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Already, I could feel something shifting inside me—sliding deeper. Thoughts grew slower. Simpler. Each word like a boulder I had to roll uphill.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I blinked. Tried to count. Wait… why count? Numbers were hard.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The world felt louder. Heavier. My heartbeat thudded in my ears like war drums.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Time passed oddly. A few minutes, maybe more. I tried to remember what I was doing… then forgot what I was remembering.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"RAHHH! WHERE ICE? ME BREAK BAD ICE!" I bellowed suddenly, slamming my fists together with a sound like thunder rolling through stone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl flinched, wings buzzing with alarm. Her glow flickered, unstable, and she backed away slightly. "Okay, that’s new. Link? Can you still hear me in there? Please, say something normal. Say anything."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>"Link? Me Link! ME </span>
      <span class="c8">STRONG ROCK GUY LINK</span>
      <span class="c3">, HA!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I laughed, big and echoing—like boulders laughing. Joke was strong. Me strong. Joke good.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">But Tatl didn’t laugh.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">She zipped in front of my face, her wings trembling now. "No no no—Link, come on. Look at me. Please look at me. You’re scaring me. This isn’t you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Her tiny hands reached forward, as if trying to grab my attention, to shake me out of it. Her voice cracked. "You’re losing it. You have to take the mask off before—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I try swat annoying bug away, flashy fairybug, urgh! Too bright. Too fast. No thinky.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Her light darted out of reach, her voice rising in panic now. "No—don’t do that! Link, please! You’re slipping too far—don’t leave me here alone!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The strength shake. My knees fall. Cracks through vision like stonebreak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I fall. Grow weak. Lose seeing… fall…</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">A deep groan escaped me as my body lurched forward, the mask peeling off my face. The world tilted. I collapsed with a thunderous thud, cracking the frozen dirt beneath me. A plume of powdery snow burst outward from the impact, and for a heartbeat I felt like the mountain itself had dropped through my chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The strength drained from me like sand through open fingers. My breath came in short, ragged gasps. The mask… it pulsed once beneath me, a strange, low throb like a heartbeat caught in stone. It was warm—not comforting, but alive, like a soul remembering it had once breathed. The sensation ran up my spine like an echo, not painful, but not gentle either—more like a distant voice calling through bone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">A final surge of heat spread through my chest like a dying heartbeat. My body began to shrink. Stone skin softened, splitting like a shell. Limbs curled inward, bone and sinew twisting and pulling tight as if retreating from the world. My spine bent sharply, ribs aching as my frame folded into itself. The weight of that other form peeled away in layers, and my mind reassembled itself in jagged flashes—thoughts stuttering into words, language reforming like ice cracking into sharp patterns.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Then came the sudden cold.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The sudden absence of that hulking strength was dizzying. Where once my center of gravity felt like a boulder, now I was a tangle of delicate limbs and aching joints. My breath fogged in the air. My shoulders folded as snow began to gather on me. My body shivered so hard I could hear my teeth knock together. I felt exposed. Small. Like a leaf that had just fallen from the tree I had been part of seconds ago.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I lay there, panting, my fragile body curling in on itself. The mask rested beside me like a spent heart, still faintly warm against the frost.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"...Tatl?" I croaked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">She hovered above me, blinking rapidly. Her glow was dim, uncertain. “Oh thank the gods... You’re back. Just barely.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Her wings trembled midair, and she darted in close, circling me once with nervous urgency before settling just beside my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“I didn’t know if you’d come back,” she whispered, her voice cracking. “You were gone, Link. Like… really gone. I was calling you and you didn’t even blink…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I blinked slowly, breath still shaking. My limbs felt like water, my muscles empty of anything but exhaustion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“I thought I’d lost you,” she murmured, barely above the hush of the wind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I remembered the sudden compulsion to put on the mask, my own arms betraying me as they forced it to my face. Tatl’s voice struck me with how much I scared her, and I recoiled from the mask that lay silent on the cold ground.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“I didn’t mean to…” I rasped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl hovered a little closer, her voice now more firm, but gentler than before. “I know. I know you didn’t. But next time, promise me something.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I glanced up at her, barely able to nod, my head still swimming from the effects of the change.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>“Don’t put it on unless we absolutely need to. I…um…</span>
      <span class="c8">we</span>
      <span class="c3"> can’t afford to lose you. Not like that.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I swallowed hard, the chill creeping back into my skin as the mask lay silently beside me. I glanced at it, then back to Tatl. I could only reply with…</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“I promise.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I groaned. My limbs trembled with the last of the lingering memory of Darmani... a memory of something ancient and terribly powerful. Lying in the snow, feeling painfully small and exposed, I understood something terrifying—how easily I could lose myself, not to darkness or evil, but to the simple comfort of unquestioned strength.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“We’re going to have to be… very careful with that thing.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>Tatl crossed her arms, frowning with concern but trying to keep her voice steady. "You were... completely gone, Link. I don’t even think you </span>
      <span class="c8">heard</span>
      <span class="c3"> me anymore. A few minutes more and you might’ve stayed gone..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I turned my head toward the mask, picking it off the ground and turning the heavy stone over in my hands. It looked harmless now—just a stone carving. But I could almost feel it watching me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I could still feel the echo of weight in my shoulders. The deep-throated roar in my ears. The mountain-heart pounding in my chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>Part of me missed it. The strength. The certainty. The fury. It reminded me of those early moments after the curse—when everything felt out of control, and I would have given anything just to </span>
      <span class="c8">know</span>
      <span class="c3"> what to do, to have purpose again. There was no fear in that form, no doubt, just motion and force. It was like being held in the arms of something terrible and vast—but safe from the cold of uncertainty. And now, stripped bare and small once more, I felt its absence like phantom limbs aching to be filled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>"It felt so... easy," I whispered. "Like I didn’t have to question anything. Just act. Be strong. Be </span>
      <span class="c8">sure.</span>
      <span class="c3">"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>Tatl's voice softened, landing beside my shoulder, her wings fluttering gently as if weighed down. She looked tired—emotionally drained—her light dimmed to a soft, flickering glow. There was worry in her eyes, but also a fragile relief, like someone who had just pulled a friend back from the edge of a cliff. "Yeah, well. That kind of power </span>
      <span class="c8">always</span>
      <span> feels easy at first. It's not meant to think. It's meant to </span>
      <span class="c8">destroy</span>
      <span class="c3">."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I nodded faintly, still staring at the mask. My breath clouded the air as I gazed over the edges of its worn stone features. Part of me missed it, missed the strength, the righteous fury... the sheer force of will.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">And that scared me more than anything else.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Suddenly, strong arms wrapped around me—like stone warmed from a fire and reverent—and I was lifted as if I weighed nothing at all. A dozen Gorons had gathered around, encircling me without my notice, their heavy brows furrowed with awe and something deeper. Their touch was gentle despite their size, like mountain winds cradling a falling leaf. One placed a hand softly on my back, steadying me not as a stranger, but as kin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I was carried back to the bonfire, its flames now crackling with renewed vigor. Sparks danced upward into the night like prayers rising skyward. Around it, the circle of stone guardians gathered. Their feet were planted like roots of a mountain, their fists resting over their hearts.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">They hummed a deep, resonant chant that vibrated up through my spine and into my ribs. It wasn’t a song made for the ears. It was for the soul. Each note reverberated through the snow-laced air like the pulse of the earth itself. I felt it stirring something in me—something old, something I didn’t recognize as mine, and yet remembered all the same.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl hovered beside me, silent but glowing warmly in the firelight, her presence a small anchor in the midst of so much reverence. She looked not at me, but at the Gorons, eyes wide with awe. Her wings flickered gently, as if moved by the music.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The chant rose with each breath the Gorons drew, echoing into the cold air and grounding itself into the very earth beneath us. It carried weight—like stone on the heart—but also comfort. I didn’t understand the words, but I knew the meaning. Honor. Grief. Hope.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Elder Boromu stepped forward, his cane tapping once against the wood of a fallen branch as he lifted his voice. His face looked older now, lined deeper with sorrow—but behind his eyes, something fierce still glowed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Link… Hero of the Draumorim, bearer of Darmani’s final breath, one who heard his call and answered with a roar. I ask you this—if the soul of our brother lives in you still, if his courage has found new flame in your heart, then speak now. Will you save us?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The heat from the bonfire wrapped around me, breathing warmth into my frozen limbs. My body still trembled from the transformation, but something inside me had settled. My heartbeat slowed. My breath returned.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I stood, slowly, legs wobbling beneath me like a newborn foal, but I stood. Around me, the Gorons watched with quiet intensity—no longer strangers. Brothers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“I will, Elder,” I said, my voice steadier than I expected. I met his eyes, then turned to the others. “You have my word.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Then come, brother, rest by the fire. Regain your strength.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The bonfire crackled warmly, sending dancing shadows across the clearing flattened by heavy feet. I nestled in beside it, the massive bodies of the Draumorim gathered loosely around the flames in a quiet, protective circle. Their presence—solid, unmoving—brought with it a strange sense of peace. I felt folded into something ancient and enduring. For the first time in what felt like ages, I let my limbs relax.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Warmth seeped into my bones, washing away the last tremors of the transformation. I watched the flames curl upward into the snowy sky, their golden tongues flickering in the dark eyes of the Gorons who now regarded me not with suspicion, but with respect and quiet camaraderie.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">It felt like family. Not the kind born from blood, but forged in silence, in danger survived, in promises made beneath sky and stone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Elder Boromu shuffled to my side, settling onto a carved stone seat with a low, gravelly grunt. He didn’t speak right away. Just stared into the fire with a heaviness in his eyes that matched the snow-laden skies above.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"You came to us in the middle of sorrow, child," he said eventually, his voice a rumble that seemed to shake loose the snow in the trees. "And gave us hope. But I must know—who are you, truly? What path led you from the land of chaos to this moment, here, now?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I nodded solemnly, the fire's warmth banishing the doubt in me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">And I told him everything.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The words poured out of me—not rehearsed, not crafted. Just raw and real. My journey through the forest, the ambush, the Skull Kid’s cruel laughter and twisted jokes, the curse that reshaped my body and severed my ties to home. I told him of the Ocarina I had lost, the time I had stolen back when I reclaimed it, the southern swamps where I had found rot and horror, but also healing and beauty. I spoke of my struggles with Lukhan, a crime boss in Clock Town, of my time with Ratt, and how we found his son. And finally, I mentioned my fear of losing the flickers of myself I still wasn’t sure I’d recovered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu listened with a heavy stillness, only his eyes moving in the firelight, glinting like slow-cooled lava. When I finished, he leaned in, placing a stone-weighted hand on my shoulder. It was solid. Grounding.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Loss never becomes easier,” Boromu said softly, his eyes reflecting a lifetime of grief. “But we, the Draumorim, carry each other's burdens. That is the true strength of the mountain. That is why Darmani trusted you, even beyond death.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>"You are no longer a stranger to us, Link of Hyrule," he continued. "You are Draumorim now. You have earned the name </span>
      <span class="c8">Rohmar</span>
      <span class="c3">, in our tongue—Stonebrother. And the mountain will remember you. Take peace now and know you are safe, with us, Rohmar Link."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Something uncoiled in my chest. Rohmar. It settled into me like it had always been there, hidden beneath the noise. Not a title. A truth. The Draumorim began a deep, rhythmic song of acceptance around me. The very earth quietly vibrated with their sound, and in a way it was deeply comforting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I smiled. It was small. It was weary.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">But it was real.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The chant around me resonated deep into my bones, not just a sound but a heartbeat shared among many. It thrummed low and ancient, as if the mountain itself remembered my name now. The firelight danced across the stone faces of the Draumorim—faces no longer wary, but open, grounded, proud. I caught Tatl’s quiet shimmer from the edge of the circle. She didn’t speak. She didn’t need to. Her light pulsed once, steady and warm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">And for the first time since leaving Hyrule, the emptiness inside me filled with something new, solid, and warm: belonging.</span>

    </h1>
    <p class="c1 c20">
      <span class="c3"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I was mostly asleep—half-dreaming, half-floating—wrapped in the smoky warmth of my dinolfos cloak, when I heard, or more like felt it: the sound of heavy, deliberate feet crunching against the frost-bitten earth. Slow. Measured. Getting closer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">My eyes snapped open, instincts coiled tight. I sat up fast, breath caught in my chest, scanning the dark perimeter of the Draumorim’s grove. For a fleeting moment, I forgot where I was. Everything felt too quiet. Too still.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The fire had burned low—just a cradle of glowing embers now, pulsing like the last heartbeat of a sleeping dragon. Their red light danced across the snow-dusted clearing, casting long shadows across the stone bodies of the Gorons slumped nearby. From where I sat, they looked less like people and more like statues—hulking shapes etched from iron and stone, motionless in the heat-flicker of dying flame. Their stone-skin backs glinted faintly in the low light: some like weathered cliffsides, others marbled with veins of dark copper and grey quartz, each scar a testament to the harshness of the mountain’s love.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The silence was so complete it almost rang in my ears—until the sound of footfalls returned. Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The largest Goron warrior, who had captured me earlier, emerged from the treeline, his figure sharp against the dark—massive, shadowed, his breath huffing in misty plumes. He didn’t speak. Only dipped his head and moved directly to Boromu, his boots sinking deep into the frost-laced earth with each step. Even the rocks seemed to tremble as he passed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu, seated like a boulder worn smooth by time, turned to hear him. The brother leaned in, whispering something too low to catch. The elder’s brow furrowed, as if the mountain itself had shifted beneath him. No words passed his lips, but something ancient stirred in his throat—a low chant, gravelly and deep, that rolled out across the camp like a tremor echoing through stone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">At once the camp began to wake.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Two more Gorons appeared at the tree line, dragging a stiff, snow-dusted figure between them. Human legs trailed through the powder, leaving a wavering trail. The shape stumbled and twisted, trying to push back against the Gorons’ iron grip, even as his strength faltered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">And then—when the flicker of firelight caught tangled, familiar dark hair, my heart stuttered as recognition hit me—relief flooded through my limbs, chased immediately by a fresh surge of worry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Ratt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">He looked like he’d clawed his way through a storm—his cheeks raw with windburn, lashes crusted in ice, lips split and tinged blue. He wore a large, poorly fitting cloak that was torn open at the shoulder, exposing pale skin beneath, and his unprotected fingers twitched with the onset of the cold. His black boots were coated in snow, laces dragging, one of them half-untied like he’d been running until he collapsed. But the moment Ratt saw me, his posture shifted. Just a little.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Despite everything, a crooked grin tugged at the corner of his mouth, wild and stubborn.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Well," he muttered through chattering teeth, eyes locked on mine with exhausted relief, "so much for stealth."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Before I could respond, Boromu’s faded blue eyes flared like tinder struck by flint.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Ahhh... more human treachery," the elder growled, his voice thick with pain. "Here to steal my son again as he slumbers in cursed dreams?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">He pointed a finger at Ratt’s chest—thick, stony, accusatory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"No more. You won’t harm us again, human. Bury him in the earth, brothers. Let the dirt consume his deceptive mind."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I was on my feet before I could think, heart slamming against my ribs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Wait—wait, he’s with me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The Gorons paused. Tension thickened like steam in frozen air. One warrior, towering with arms like granite pillars, growled low.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Spies are not brothers. They bring ruin to kin."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"He’s not a spy…" I stepped forward, planting myself between Ratt and the circle of stone. "He wouldn’t hurt us. He came for me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu’s voice was slow and seismic, but clear. "If the Stonebrother vouches for him... then let him speak."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The Gorons hesitated, then finally released their grip. Ratt stumbled and brushed himself off, teeth chattering.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Thanks," he muttered to me, quieter now, almost sincere. Then louder, with his usual edge, "Look, I wasn’t spying. I was following."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Why?" I asked, arms crossing—part irritation, part bracing against the cold. "I told you it was too dangerous out here!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Because you’re in danger. Again."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">He rubbed his arms, pacing a slow, uneven circle on the frosted ground. His boots crunched faintly with every step. "Lukhan’s still after you. He remembers something went wrong… not the details, but the feeling. That you cheated him. And now he’s losing his mind over it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">My stomach clenched, a cold knot twisting deep inside.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"I overheard some of his thugs talking about it," Ratt went on. "They were drunk and extra loud. He’s offering a huge bounty for anyone that finds you. Doesn’t even know why—just needs to get you alone and 'rip the answers out,' they said."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">A ripple of growls rolled through the camp. The Draumorim bristled. Some stood slowly, their massive hands clenching into fists, the tension thick in their wide, armored shoulders. One Goron’s eyes flared like embers stoked by wind, while another’s nostrils flared sharply, teeth bared in the beginnings of a snarl. The older warriors, the largest among the group, exchanged hard glances, the kind that spoke of scars and battles already fought. Even those who remained seated stiffened, their backs straightening like pillars bracing for impact. The youngest among them, an adolescent about my size who had stuck by Boromu's sleeping son like a personal guardian, gripped the edge of the cart a little tighter. His jaw set tight, mirroring the hardened expressions of his elders as though instinctively taking on their fury.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Ratt held up his hands slightly, voice dipping. "He thinks you’ve got something. Power. Magic. He’s hunting you with everything he’s got. Him and every dog he keeps on a leash."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl hovered to my side, her glow hardening. The embers cracked behind us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The cold felt suddenly sharper.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Look—you can’t go back to town, I can’t go back to town. They’re hunting all of us, Link. It would be far safer if we traveled together." Ratt’s voice was quiet but steady, more reasoned than pleading. It made sense. It made too much sense.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Hagh… fine," I muttered, my breath fogging in the dim air. "You can come. But you have to stay out of any fights if we get into any. I can’t—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The words choked in my throat. Darmani’s loss still carved deep, like a wound that hadn’t scabbed over. I could still feel the pulse of his last memory echoing through the mask strapped at my side. The thought of losing Ratt too—another soul brave enough to stay close—was almost unbearable. Because if I lost him too, I wasn’t sure there’d be anything of me left worth saving.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">My voice softened, brittle around the edges. "I just don’t want you getting hurt."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">He didn’t reply. But he looked at me in that way he sometimes did—sharp eyes, intelligent, as if seeing straight through all my defenses. It unnerved me more than any enemy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I turned my gaze skyward. The horizon had begun to shift from obsidian to slate, a dark grey hinting at the promise of dawn. The stars above flickered faintly, the last holdouts against morning. Time was pressing in on all sides. If Lukhan really was hunting us, it wouldn't be long before our presence here put the Draumorim here at risk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">No more needless death. No more hollows filled with snow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"We should pack up," I said, turning to Elder Boromu. "Move out to the mountain. Is your son awake yet?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu’s massive shoulders sank visibly, grief pulling at him like heavy stone. His voice lowered, rumbling with old pain. "No… he still slumbers. I had hoped that returning him to us—returning him to me—would be enough. That hearing my voice would stir his soul. But alas, he and Darmani were bound tightly. He cared deeply for the boy. The silence has been long."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu’s gaze drifted to the mask at my side—Darmani’s carved visage still locked in a roaring defiance against death itself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Perhaps," Boromu rumbled slowly, "he will respond to you… while wearing Darmani’s power?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Ohhh no, we’re not doing that again!" Tatl darted between us like a spark, her wings a blur of frantic energy. Her glow pulsed with urgency, casting flashes of light across our faces. "We almost lost Link last time! I don’t care how much Darmani meant to the kid—what if she doesn’t come back next time? If Link dies, the whole world is lost, what then?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu raised a gnarled, stone-scarred hand, a slow gesture meant to calm more than command. He nodded gently.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Be at ease, little sprite. I hear your worry, and I share it. There is another way—one we intended to try before my son was taken from us."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">But I didn’t answer them right away. My hand had already drifted to the mask at my hip, fingers brushing its carved edges, feeling the cold weight of it pulse faintly through the palm of my glove. The mask throbbed like a second heartbeat—dormant now, but waiting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">There was power in it. Not just strength, but certainty. When I wore it, the world made sense in brutal, simple terms. Enemy. Obstacle. Path. It dulled everything else—the fear, the guilt, even the fragile threads of identity that still held me together. I didn’t have to feel the things that confused me. I didn’t have to remember what I’d lost.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>But I also didn’t feel </span>
      <span class="c8">myself</span>
      <span class="c3">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I remembered how the thoughts had slowed, the words becoming fewer and further between. How my limbs had moved without hesitation, but also without nuance. It had been like sinking into stone. Comfortable. Heavy. And terrifying.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>I stared down at the mask, its eyes empty and wide. Darmani’s courage was still in there—I knew that. His honor. His grief. But so was the threat of losing </span>
      <span class="c12 c23 c8">me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">And the worst part? A small, traitorous part of me wanted to give in again. Just for a while. Just to stop feeling so damn much. It was terrifying, how much I wanted to lose myself again, to escape into strength that asked no questions and demanded no truth. The mask promised oblivion, a soothing void where fear and confusion couldn’t follow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I swallowed hard and tore my hand away, as if the mask had burned me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"There has to be another way," I said quietly, not meeting Tatl’s eyes. "There has to be."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu’s expression didn’t change, but something softened behind his eyes. A flicker of understanding. Or maybe… respect.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">His voice grew quiet, touched with sorrow. "Our home has a sacred place… a chamber of awakening. It is a quiet hall built into the heart of the mountain, a place for meditation, for communion with the spirits and the breath of earth. When Darmani left to confront the Divine Beast, my son—Maro—fell into a deep slumber. Grief weighed heavily on him, and the loss of Darmani was like a mountain falling on his heart. One of our reverend Elders suggested placing him in the chamber, where the mountain's spirit might guide him through his sorrow."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu’s gaze darkened. "But before we could seal the chamber, the thief struck. While Maro slept in mourning, defenseless and alone, he was stolen from us."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">He turned, his eyes sweeping across his gathered kin—each one standing silently, fists over hearts, heads bowed to the past.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">With renewed resolve, he faced me once more. "If even in the sanctuary of the grove we are hunted and tormented, then there is no point in pleading to the world beyond. We will do as we always have—solve our own struggles, protect our own blood."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">He lifted his chin. "Brothers, gather your gear. We return home. This time, we will be victorious—or we will be extinguished with the rest of the world."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The response was wordless but immediate. In a flurry of motion both swift and quiet, the camp stirred to life. Great packs were hoisted, carved tools and prayer stones wrapped in cloth. One of the Draumorim rolled slowly through the fire pit, quenching the last embers with a hiss and a gust of ash, leaving behind only the faint warmth clinging to the stones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I shivered as the heat fled the grove with the embers being extinguished. Snowflakes caught on my lashes. My breath curled in the air like smoke.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Turning, I stepped closer to Ratt, who was still pulling his cloak tighter with trembling fingers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"How… how are you feeling? Do you need anything?" My voice came out gentler than I meant it to. "You look half frozen to death."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">He gave a crooked smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes as he shivered. "I’ve been worse. B-but if you have a s-spare magic coat in your pocket, I won’t s-say no."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I couldn’t help but return the smile, heart softening at his resilience—even beneath frost and fatigue, he still found a way to joke. That stubborn, crooked humor of his had a way of piercing through the cold. I looked down at my gloved hand where the enchanted ring still rested, faintly pulsing with a dormant heat. It hadn’t been tested much, not really—but something about it always felt alive when I was in danger.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I hesitated, quietly watching the Draumorim move around with disciplined precision. What if it hurt him? What if I couldn’t control it? The thought of fire engulfing and consuming his skin made my stomach twist—but the way he shivered, the way his breath came in ragged clouds, I knew I had to try.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I focused my will into the ring, steadying my breath. At once, it flared to life—its jewels sparking with sudden crimson light, like coals catching flame.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Here," I said softly, offering my hand. "Take it. Maybe this ring will help warm you up? I’m… still not sure what it does. But I hope it doesn’t incinerate you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Haha—I’d take b-being set on fire over having my arms rattle out of their sockets."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Ratt reached out slowly, his bare fingers trembling as they brushed against mine. The moment he made contact, I willed warmth into him—gently, intentionally. The ring pulsed, and a trail of soft red flame curled upward from our joined hands, licking across his arm in a ribbon of glowing heat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">He yelped and pulled away instinctively. The flames vanished with the broken contact, and he stumbled back a step, eyes wide.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>"Y-you know," he stammered, examining his unscathed arm, "I was </span>
      <span class="c8">kidding</span>
      <span class="c3"> about the fire thing! Are you sure this is safe?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"No idea," I admitted. "Did you get burned? If you did I'm sure one of th-"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"No, no—actually... It feels great." He interrupted, looking over his arm in amazement, and then grinned as if remembering a fond moment in the past.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Like when I got to take a real bath once. A hot one. Gods, that was the best day of my life." He chuckled weakly and waved off my concern. "Let’s do it again. Seriously."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I exhaled in relief, letting the tension ease from my shoulders. Once more, I pressed my intention into the ring, and again the red flame unfurled—dancing over his arms and shoulders like a shawl of living warmth. This time, he didn’t flinch. The flames didn’t burn—they glowed softly, casting golden-orange light across the snow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Ratt stopped shivering. His breath no longer came in shudders. He stared at our hands in awe, his expression uncharacteristically quiet as the fire licked gently around him, warming him from the bones outward.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">He looked up at me, and for a moment, didn’t speak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The cold wind still whispered across the clearing, but between us, there was only the hush of firelight and shared silence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I felt that warmth blooming in my chest again, the flutter of keese attacking my guts, and I pulled away with a disconcerted gasp. Why did this boy always make me feel like this? What was wrong with me? My pulse thundered in my ears, my throat dry. Why did this moment—this quiet intimacy—unravel me more than any danger? Why did I crave it even as I fled from it?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>It wasn’t just nerves. It wasn’t just fear. It was something far more dangerous—</span>
      <span class="c12 c23 c8">hope.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Hope that someone could see me through this cursed form. That someone could hold onto who I was even as I unraveled. And that hope was painful. Because every time I felt it, it reminded me how far I’d already drifted from who I used to be. From the hero I once was.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The warmth around Ratt faded when I pulled my hand away abruptly, the glowing tendrils of flame shrinking and vanishing like a dream ending too soon. He blinked in confusion, his expression turning soft with concern.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"What happened? Are you ok?" he asked, voice gentler than I expected.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>"I’m… fine. It’s nothing." I forced my tone flat, the softness retreating as quickly as the heat. I didn’t trust it. I didn’t trust </span>
      <span class="c8">myself.</span>
      <span class="c3"> "Are you warm now?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">He rubbed his arm, eyes still on me. "Y-yeah? I’m ok now, heh… well should we…uh, get going?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">But his voice faltered. Not from cold this time, but something quieter—something searching. His gaze lingered longer than it should have, scanning my face as if trying to read a language half-forgotten. There was hesitation there, barely veiled; a pull he didn’t yet understand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">His eyes—those sea green, intelligent eyes—betrayed something deeper than curiosity, or confusion… beneath it all was a glimmer of fondness. Maybe he didn’t know what it meant yet. Maybe he hadn’t figured it out himself. But it was there, just behind the way his breath caught when our hands met, the way his shoulders had dipped not just from relief, but something softer. Something warmer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I turned away before either of us could speak, trying to bury the heat still curling under my ribs. My ponytail caught on my bow and I flung it behind me angrily.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">He didn’t understand. How could he? He didn’t know what it meant to lose everything you were, to lose your face, your body, to feel your mind slowly slip away. To want someone and be terrified of being really seen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>And goddess help me, the way he looked at me—like I was still just </span>
      <span class="c8">me</span>
      <span class="c3">—was more dangerous than any curse. I couldn’t give in any more to this, I needed discipline, order, willpower. I had to keep myself whole before losing everything I was, or else this world would die along with everyone in it… including Ratt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">So I rushed away—too fast, too sharp—pretending I had something urgent to do, anything that could excuse the sudden heat rising behind my eyes. The tribe was already mostly packed, but I threw myself into movement anyway, half-heartedly checking bags and stomping down snow, needing the distraction like a shield.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Stupid… stupid, what am I doing…” I muttered under my breath as I kicked at a pile of powdery snow gathering on a young sapling. My voice cracked at the edges.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl floated up beside me, her wings humming low. "Link, what’s going on? Did that kid say something to you? Do you want me to smack him around a bit?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I jumped a little—I had almost forgotten she was there. Her tone was sharp, but beneath it, I could hear the flicker of worry. The white fairy’s wings trembled midair, and she darted in close with a soft chime.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"No… he… urgh… nothing happened," I said, too fast. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">My throat tightened. My fists clenched so hard my knuckles ached. It was easier to lie than explain the fire curling under my skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"I’m just… frustrated. With losing Darmani. With having another cursed form shoved onto me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">My hand gripped the Goron mask hanging from my belt, my fingers curling tightly around its jagged stone edge. I let the pain bite into my fingertips. It was easier to blame the mask—this heavy, unfeeling thing—than admit what was actually burning under my skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">In truth, I was grateful for it. Grateful for the strength it gave me. Grateful for the way it buried my emotions under slabs of stone and muscle. It was like armor I could slip into whenever the world asked too much of me. Whenever I was afraid. Whenever I felt too much.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Especially now, when feeling too much might be the most dangerous thing of all. It left me open, weak, unfocused. I was so tempted to press the cold stone to my face and bury myself beneath a mountain of strength—let the sheer weight of that other body shield me from this trembling self I barely recognized anymore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Who was I even trying to protect anymore? Myself? Ratt? This world? The lines were blurring. I used to know what I was. A swordsman. A hero. A man tempered by fire and steel. Now I was none of those things—just a ghost flickering between forms, between faces. And the mask… the mask didn’t ask questions. It only obeyed its nature. It didn’t ask who I was becoming. It didn’t care.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Link, I know all this is… hard. But you’re not alone, you know?” Tatl’s voice was softer now, brushing against my thoughts like a hand reaching through the dark. “You don’t have to carry this by yourself this time.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Despite her brashness, the gentle hum of her wings felt like a steadying hand, reminding me quietly that I wasn’t alone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>"You’ve basically got a whole </span>
      <span class="c8">army</span>
      <span class="c3"> of Gorons who’d probably die for you. And that kid... as annoying as he is... nearly froze to death just to warn you. That has to count for something."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Her words pressed gently into the hollows of my chest, but they didn’t fill the space. Not yet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I didn’t respond at first. My eyes followed the Draumorim as they moved methodically around the grove, sweeping away traces of their presence with branch and stone. The fire was buried. The tracks smoothed. But it was like trying to erase footprints from wet clay. The signs were still there if someone knew how to look.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>And Lukhan </span>
      <span class="c8">knew</span>
      <span class="c3"> how to look.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I rubbed at my temple, the tension in my head blooming like a migraine behind my eyes. I didn’t want to feel any of this—grief, fear, longing, hope. But it clung to me like snow melting down my spine.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">My hands trembled, just a little. The kind of tremble you only feel when you know you’re standing on the edge of emotions that could unmake you.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“I… know that, Tatl. Thank you.” My voice came out rougher than I wanted. "I’ll be okay. I promise. Don’t worry about me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">A lie, again. But I needed to believe it long enough to move.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Let’s just get to the mountains and stop this cursed winter. I’m sure Boromu would let Ratt stay with them too, if I asked. That way we could finish healing the world like that mask salesman said, and I can end this curse without worrying about him getting hurt. At the end of this maybe then I can finally go home to where I belong."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The words tasted strange. "Home" no longer had a shape.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I paused, my breath misting in the quiet air, caught in the brief silence before the next storm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"I’ve learned my lesson..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">But even as I said it, a part of me whispered back:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c12 c23 c8">Not enough.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The words echoed like footsteps on frozen stone, distant but unrelenting. I shoved them down, deep, where they couldn’t bloom into doubt. Not here. Not now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu had stepped beside me—quiet, steady—his presence like the hush before snowfall. I hadn’t noticed him approach, but his scent carried earth and ash, and the quiet gravity he held was as familiar as the mountain itself. How long had he been standing there? Had he heard everything?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I hated that thought. But he gave no sign that he had, offered no judgment. Instead, he only looked ahead and motioned to the shadowed treeline, where the snow gathered like a breath waiting to be exhaled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Rhomar Link,” he said, his voice a low rumble of ancient stone, “the path ahead is the direction of the mountain. If we are to make it to Draumor by nightfall, we must begin the journey. I fear this snow will only slow us down further… but we will follow your lead. Let Darmani’s spirit guide you, and you will find your way home.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Home.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I nodded once, the word once again stinging more than it soothed. I scanned the camp—the Goron brothers were ready, solemn and quiet, their preparations finished. The fire pit had been flattened and brushed over, the snow swept clean, but still, the earth held memory. Tracks too wide to hide. Evidence of life that would not be erased by branches alone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I looked toward the trees and found Ratt standing apart from the group, leaning against a frost-laced trunk. His arms were crossed, but his gaze was fixed on me with quiet worry. I met his eyes for half a breath—then looked away before either of us could speak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Okay. Let’s start moving, my brothers.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">My voice came out flat. Cold. Like iron hammered into a blade. Resilient. Or at least pretending to be.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The sky was bleeding into a pale, bruised violet, the color of old sorrow. Dawn crept up slow and silent, veiled behind clouds thick as wool and heavy with warning. A storm was coming—we could all feel it. The cold was sharpening, not easing. The quiet pressed down, too complete to trust. Even the snow, which drifted in gentle spirals, felt like it was holding its breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I raised my hand and signaled forward, stepping beside Boromu as the caravan began to move. The Draumorim followed in silent rhythm, a procession of living stone, their footsteps heavy but sure. The cart carrying Maro rolled behind us, the boy still curled in his deep, silent sleep, guarded by the youngest of the tribe. The sight of him—so small, so still—sent a quiet pang through my heart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The cold deepened as we walked. Flurries stung my cheeks like tiny needles. I reached for the mask at my side. Its surface was cold to the touch, but the promise of strength beneath it pulsed faintly like a heartbeat in stone. The mask didn’t ask who I was. It didn’t care what I felt. It just gave me something to be that wasn’t... this. The rough, carved edges dug painfully into my palm, a welcome distraction from the ache tightening my chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I could wear it, become the mountain again—lose myself inside its silence, where nothing could touch me. Where love and fear and longing could not follow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">But no. Not yet. That strength came with a cost I could no longer afford to pay casually. I needed to stay present. I needed to remember who I was.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Ratt kept his distance, trailing behind the group near the cart. I caught glimpses of him chatting with the young Goron pushing it—light words, a half-smile, shoulders hunched against the cold. He laughed once—short, uncertain. Like a bird chirping trying to join the flock, but not quite finding its place.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I turned away quickly, pretending not to notice, pretending it didn’t echo in the hollowed-out chambers of my chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I pushed my boots harder into the snow, let the cold bite deeper, welcomed it. It kept me sharp. It kept me focused.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">No more distractions.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Just the mountain. Just the path ahead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The trail bent upward, narrowing into a slope choked with crooked pine and half-buried stone. Trunks lined either side like ancient pillars, their bark laced with frost, their branches heavy with snow. The wind had quieted for now, but I could feel it waiting. Breathing. Watching. A presence, not just a pressure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The only sound was the crunch of feet in powder and the distant creak of trees groaning under winter’s weight. Somewhere above, a hawk cried out—sharp, brief, and alone. The sound pierced the stillness like a blade through cloth, then vanished into the hush. Light filtered down in slanted beams, pale and cold, gilding the ridge in silver and sorrow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">It would have been beautiful, if it didn’t feel like the mountain was holding its breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu walked beside me in silence, his great frame moving with a kind of reverent stillness. His breath steamed out in low clouds, curling around his beard. Once, he glanced skyward and murmured something beneath his breath—low and gravelly, like earth remembering its dead. A prayer. Or a warning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I didn’t ask. I didn’t need to.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Behind us, the Draumorim moved as one—quiet, solemn, their feet sinking deep into the growing snow drifts. Their shapes looked carved from the mountain itself, but even they carried tension in their shoulders now. The silence between us wasn’t peace. It was vigilance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Ratt trailed behind, near the cart, wrapped in cloak and uncertainty. His steps were steady, but his eyes never stopped moving. Once, I felt his gaze brush the back of my neck, but I didn’t turn. I couldn’t. Not now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">As we crested the next ridge, the world unfurled beyond the tall pines.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Mountains loomed in every direction—towering cliff faces, sweeping ravines, and jagged peaks dusted with snow like ash on old bones. The mountains looked like the ribs of a giant laid bare to the cold, as if the land itself had died and we were marching through its remains. Dawn had arrived, but the sky wore a deep slate gray, heavy with brooding clouds that shed flurries like whispered curses. The air was thinner here, and the light diffused through the snow-heavy veil, softening the world into something dreamlike.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">What lay before us was breathtaking, even in shadow. This place held a kind of sacredness, a hush woven into the ridges and slopes. It felt older than time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Far below, forests of pine and spruce blanketed the foothills like sleeping giants. Their emerald needles were crusted white, boughs bending under winter’s weight. A wide valley opened beneath us, and at its edge roared a mighty waterfall—its cascade disappearing into a cloud of mist that billowed like a dragon’s exhale. The water glittered with an inner light, carving silver lines through the landscape as it fed the winding rivers and creeks that stitched through the forest beyond.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">It was beauty carved from stone and breath. Alive, yet silent. Harsh, yet beckoning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu stood beside me, his voice a gravel-smooth murmur over the wind. “Our home is just up those falls, Rhomar Link. There is a great hotspring at the heart of the monastery. We call it Vah Kel'Darah. In the Hylian tongue, it means Sacred Life from the Mountain Deep. From it, the mountain breathes. The warmth keeps our home alive—our crops, our young, even the old ones who dream beside it.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">His gaze darkened, jaw setting like a landslide. “But this cursed winter creeps deeper with every hour. If we do not stop Goht, even Vah Kel’Darah will freeze… and with it, all we built will vanish.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The Draumorim had begun their descent into the valley, broad backs bent slightly against the chill wind. Their silhouettes moved slowly, like migrating stones. I lingered at the ridge, my eyes still locked on the beauty below—the frozen rivers, the breath of mist, the distant plume of smoke curling up from a lone cottage far out in the trees.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I understood why they chose this place.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">They came from fire and ash, death and destruction. But here, there was water. Motion. Abundance. A mountain that breathed and gave life.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Ratt’s approach broke the quiet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“H-hey, Link,” he said gently, voice careful, eyes searching. “Are you okay? Did… did I do something to upset you?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">His words were hesitant, but earnest. Honest in a way that pierced the frost I’d layered over my thoughts.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">It stung—because he truly meant it. He truly wanted to help. And it would have been easier if he didn’t.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">That only made the feelings twisting inside me more intense. More impossible. Like a vine of warmth trying to grow in frozen ground.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The kind of feelings that weren’t supposed to take root in someone like me. Not a hero. Not a sword. Not a mask.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I couldn’t meet his eyes. My breath fogged between us, caught in a gust of wind that scattered the flurries like ash shaken from a dying hearth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“No,” I said, too quickly. “I just need to concentrate on my task. Don’t worry about me, ok? I’m fine. You just focus on staying alive.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">My voice was cold, clipped. Sharper than I meant it to be. I turned away before I could regret it, falling into step beside Boromu.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c11">
      <span class="c3">“Right… sure,” he mumbled, clearly hurt but quickly masking it with a forced smile.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I caught his smile out of the corner of my eye—but his eyes… they sank. Like he’d just swallowed something bitter. My heart clenched, then turned away. I didn’t want to feel that guilt. I didn’t want to feel anything at all.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The snow thickened in the air around us, as if the mountain itself had taken notice. I pulled my cloak tighter and walked faster.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl flitted beside my ear, voice low. “Hey Link, you sure you’re okay?” she whispered, settling onto my shoulder. Her tiny hands braced against my collar. “I mean I’m all for ditching him, but he’d probably die out here alone. You want me to tell him to scram anyway?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“No…” I whispered back, watching the fog of my breath melt into the wind. “I don’t want him to freeze to death. He’s… fine.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I glanced back once. Just once. He was still walking, hands tucked in his sleeves, shoulders hunched against the wind. Alone, but not by choice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“I just have to keep my mind sharp and focused,” I said softly. “Not worrying about his safety is all.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">But the truth clung to my heart like the frost clinging to everything here. I was already worried about him. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">We continued on our way down into the valley in a single file, the leader being the largest Goron, who I had come to know as Gromi. The further we traveled into the valley, the more uneasy the atmosphere felt. The wind rose sharply, tearing through the trees with renewed force, carrying with it a whisper of ancient sorrow—a warning, or perhaps a prophecy of what lay ahead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The flurries thickened with every step, whirling in spirals that bit at our faces and buried the trail behind us. The sky had vanished into white, and the wind howled with the voice of something ancient and relentless. I could feel the mountain shifting, watching, as if it knew we didn’t belong here. The sky bled into a bruised violet, the color of old sorrow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Somewhere ahead, Boromu raised his arm and pointed to the rising smoke of unseen warmth curling faintly into the storm. Shelter—if we could reach it in time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">And behind me, through the veil of snow, Ratt’s form trudged forward—smaller than he had seemed before. But still there. Still following.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The silence felt like a breath held in my chest—too long, too tight—waiting for the moment it would all shatter.</span>
    </p>

    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">As we traveled down the slope, the wind started to blast us in waves of snow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">It didn’t rise gradually—it struck. Sharp, sudden, biting. Laden with frost and something older. Snow peeled from the trees in choking clouds. My cloak snapped against my body like a sail, the fabric clawing at my arms. I pulled it tight, heart pounding beneath layers of wool and dread.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The clouds above had changed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">No longer gentle gray. They churned with bruised violet and sickly steel, twisting like coiled serpents across the peaks. Thunderheads high above moved like predators, slow and full of purpose. The cliffs and jagged ridgelines were beginning to vanish beneath a crawling veil of white, their shapes dissolving into the white horizon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The blizzard was inevitable. No longer a threat—an arrival. We had to find shelter, and soon, or else we would all be buried under snow and ice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl darted beside my face, wings shimmering like shards of starlight, frantic and stuttering in the wind. Her voice trembled as she fought the gale. "Link... that doesn't look good."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I looked up. And in that moment, I saw it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">A wall of white—not mist, not fog, but solid wind—an avalanche of air and frost hurtling toward us from the far side of the valley like a colossal hand descending from the sky.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu stopped abruptly, planting his feet with the weight of stone. He lifted his head and let out a low groaning call that vibrated through the rising wind—a sound like ancient earth shifting in its sleep. The caravan of Draumorim paused, then moved with calm precision, gathering into a defensive circle around their elder. I shielded my face from the snow’s bite and pressed forward. The brothers parted the way for me, their expressions grim, as Ratt and Tatl stayed close at my back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“What do we do now? Should we find shelter?” I asked, my voice barely audible over the shrieking wind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu nodded, concern weighing heavily in his old, frost-lined eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“There is a passage…” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu's ancient shoulders slumped slightly as he spoke, as though the very weight of the mountain rested upon him. His voice was strong, but carried a deep sorrow—the choice he offered was one he had hoped never to make. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“An old proving ground—sacred to us. It was sealed when Goht began to rage. Monsters had found their way into the chambers, and Darmani was forced to seal the exit to protect Vah Kel’Darah from desecration. But the entrance lies here, in this valley. If we pass through it, we will reach Draumor—our monastery, our heart. Yet it will not be safe. I fear the creatures that claimed it still linger there.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">He turned to face me fully. “But with you—and Darmani’s spirit—guiding us, we have a far better chance in there than out here.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The snow angled sideways now, stinging like sand—sharp, blinding, relentless. Each gust was like a fist, knocking breath from my lungs and slicing at exposed skin. The snow bit harder than arrows, burying us slowly, mercilessly. My bones felt brittle, close to shattering. The horizon vanished beneath the storm’s veil, swallowed whole by white fury. Trees around us became ghostly silhouettes, half-seen phantoms shifting in and out of the swirling gale. The air itself was an assault, stabbing into my lungs with every breath, sharp as broken ice. It smelled of copper and cold iron—like blood on a frozen blade.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“That sounds w-way better t-than out h-h-here!” Tatl stammered, her glow dim as she dove into the folds of my cloak, wings shivering against my chest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I could barely feel my fingers anymore. A deep ache had begun to settle in my arms and legs, creeping in like frostbite. I clenched my jaw and focused my will into the ring on my hand. The gem flared to life, and a sudden bloom of warmth spilled around me—soft orange flames licking over my clothes and skin without burning. It felt like being cradled beside a hearth, like the memory of a fire in the deepest night. I exhaled a shaking breath of relief and almost forgot about Ratt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“S-so d-do we have a p-p-p-plan?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Ratt stumbled up beside me, his voice ragged from cold. His face was red from windburn, lips cracking, breath huffing in pale clouds. I stepped slightly closer, letting the heat from the ring spill toward him. He didn’t lean in—but I felt the way he eased as it reached his side.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“We’re going to pass through some caves, I think. Right, Elder?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu nodded slowly, his great brow furrowed beneath a growing crust of snow. The Draumorim had formed a tight cluster behind him, massive bodies huddled together like boulders weathering a storm, their faces turned to me—not with doubt, but with weight. Expectation. Trust.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“We will pass through the Flame Hollows, brothers,” Boromu intoned, his voice steady against the wind. “A path once sacred—now deadly, and sealed. But today… it opens again. Rhomar Link will protect and defend us.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The expressions of the large and imposing Gorons that surrounded us were taut with unease. I could see the flicker of hesitation in their eyes, even among the most stalwart of them. This was no ordinary path—it was one they had deliberately sealed away, a wound in the mountain left to fester in silence. But now, with the blizzard bearing down like a beast from the heavens, there was no other path forward. Only in returning to that place of trial could we hope to survive.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">With a grim nod from Boromu, the Draumorim moved forward as one. Their discipline was swift, practiced—born of centuries surviving a world that was rarely kind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Gromi, take the lead. You know where the entrance lies here!” Boromu called out over the roar of the storm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The burly Goron who had apprehended me the night before grunted, stepping to the front of the caravan with grim purpose. He unwound a thick coil of rope from his travel pack and secured it tightly around his waist. Without words, he passed the other end to the next brother in line, who did the same. One by one, the Gorons formed a living chain—binding themselves to one another in a silent pact of survival, no one would be left behind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The brothers encircled us, shielding us from the worst of the wind. I felt like I was inside a massive turtle shell, protected on all sides by stone and willpower. Their faces were drawn tight, breaths misting in the freezing air. Even the hot-blooded Gorons were shivering now, their volcanic cores no match for this unnatural chill. It made my stomach twist, knowing that if I failed my brothers would die slowly by freezing to death.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I was endlessly grateful for the ring—its warmth was more than comfort. It was life. Without it, I could feel my own bones locking up, my joints going stiff. Within the enchantment’s embrace, a soft orange flame curled outward like a hearthfire wrapped around my form.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl had taken refuge inside my cloak, her tiny body tucked beneath the layers near my back. I could feel her faint weight riding against the hero’s mask I carried there—our strange and terrible burden.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">But Ratt… he was still shivering. Violently. His lips were pale and his jaw clenched as he trudged forward beside me, teeth audibly clicking.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The heat didn’t reach him. Not fully. The magic clung tight to me alone. My pride fought me, even then—as I wrestled with my emotions, but I looked at him, saw that he was suffering. Ratt’s breaths came in ragged clouds, his shoulders hunched painfully inward as if the very air were knives pressed against his skin. Each step looked painful, every breath a wince. I swallowed the tight knot in my throat and offered my gloved hand to him. He blinked, surprised, his expression softening as he hesitated. Then, wordlessly, he took it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">His fingers were ice. But the moment we connected, I pulsed will through the ring again—extending the warmth outward, willing it to encompass him as well. A bloom of orange light flared softly around us, like sunrise caught in snowfall. The warmth surged through the air between us, wrapping us both in a protective veil. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Ratt inhaled sharply, relief flooding his features. His shivering slowed. The tension in his shoulders eased.  As the gentle flame spilled between us, I felt more than warmth—I felt connection, a tether of golden heat binding us together. The glow rippled softly, matching the rhythm of our intertwined breaths, as if the ring itself recognized our closeness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Around us, the nearest Gorons felt the warmth too, leaning subtly inward. Even Boromu stepped closer, his stone face tilting slightly toward the glow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">For a moment, there was no storm. Just warmth. Just breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I didn’t let go of Ratt’s hand. But the moment my stomach started to twist again I steeled my willpower and looked forward, hardening my resolve to see us safely through the mountain. If there was going to be a fight, I needed to be ready… not distracted like an idiot.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">We kept moving through the intense howling wind, one foot at a time, the rope between the Gorons tugging like a lifeline in the whiteout. My cloak snapped around my legs, my boots nearly vanishing beneath the snowdrifts, but finally we saw it—a stone archway carved into the cliff face, half-buried beneath a mantle of ice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The group disengaged the circle with practiced ease, tightening formation into double file as we approached. The entrance loomed above us like a waiting maw, its teeth formed by icicles hanging thick from the arch. But the way forward was sealed—entombed in a thick wall of solid ice that shimmered with a pale blue light, nearly opaque and hard as metal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu stepped forward and placed a heavy hand against the surface. Frost spread beneath his palm. “The breath of the mountain has stopped here,” he said, voice heavy with quiet reverence and sorrow. “Only strength and stone may undo what has been silenced.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The storm howled behind us, the snow slashing like knives at our backs, but for a moment, all was still. I stepped closer, eyes tracing the runes carved faintly into the frozen arch. They pulsed softly, barely visible beneath the ice, like a heartbeat slowed to the edge of death.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl peeked out from my collar, her wings brushing my neck. “You’re not seriously thinking of putting that mask on again, are you?” she said, half a whisper, half a plea.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“I have to.” I kept my voice low, not looking at her. “There’s no other way.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">There was a wingbeat of silence, then a flicker of movement as she flitted around to face me. Her glow was sharp, her wings a blur in the bitter air. “You almost lost yourself last time! Do you really think it’s worth the risk?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu’s gaze settled on me—deep, patient, sorrowful. “Only you can choose, Rhomar Link. But the mountain must breathe again… or we will not survive the night.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I reached down, my fingers brushing the jagged stone of the mask at my belt. It was cold, but pulsed faintly with something deeper—something ancient. I could feel Darmani waiting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl's wings buzzed frantically, shimmering with a fragile, anxious light. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Please, Link…' she pleaded softly, voice tight with genuine fear. 'Come back to me this time. Don’t lose yourself again.'</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“I’m still me,” I said quietly. “I’ll come back. I promise.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl hovered in front of me, silent now, her light dimmed to a faint glow. I met her eyes for just a moment. Hurt flickered there, raw and unguarded, but she didn’t stop me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I took a breath—deep, sharp—and pressed the mask to my face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Pain. Heat. Weight. But not like before. The agony was there, yes—but muted, familiar now. A rhythm my body had begun to remember. Like pulling on old armor and letting it fuse with muscle and marrow. The rush of stone wrapped around my limbs, thickening me, grounding me. My thoughts dimmed, simplified. Not dulled. Focused.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Strength returned.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I felt it in the creak of my spine, the swell of my chest, the tightening of fists like boulders. I opened my eyes, and the world answered with silence and weight. Every sound deeper, slower—like I’d fallen into the breath of the mountain itself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The warrior stood again. And I knew what I had to do!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I stepped forward, the earth groaning beneath me, each footfall cracking frost like eggshell. I roared—low and resonant—and slammed my fists into the frozen gate. The impact shook the stone around it. Cracks spiderwebbed instantly, veins of light against ice. I struck again. And again. Until the wall screamed and shattered, shards exploding like crystal rain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">From the breach came warmth. Real, living warmth. It rushed over us like a sigh from a sleeping volcano—sulfur, smoke, iron. The smell of something ancient and sacred.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The Flame Hollows breathed, fighting back against the frozen gusts behind us like an army unleashed against its enemies.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Behind me, I turned just enough to see Tatl hovering, her light dimmed and hesitant. Her tiny form trembled—not from cold, but something unspoken. Her voice didn’t come. Only silence, small and echoing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Ratt stood beside her, snow clinging to his lashes and shaggy black hair, eyes wide—not in fear, not in surprise, just… almost in awe. Seeing a true Goron must be a real reward for that kid!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Let’s move,” I rumbled, my voice now carved from stone. “The mountain breathes again.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Inside, the air changed immediately—still freezing, but no longer biting. The wind no longer screamed. It was a breath held in stone, ancient and waiting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The cavern swallowed us in silence. The only sound was the crunch of boots and stone-shod feet against the frost-veined path. My footsteps echoed dully, like the mountain was listening.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Blue crystals lined the walls in fractured veins, their glow faint but alive. They pulsed dimly in rhythm, like a heartbeat long buried beneath the earth. The light shimmered against the frost-clung stone, cold as moonlight and just as distant. When it caught the frost, it turned the whole passage into a corridor of ghosts.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The path beneath us bore the memory of reverence. Curling etchings danced across the floor—ceremonial designs now half-swallowed by grime and shattered rock. This had been a sacred place once. I could feel it in the weight of the air. In the way sound refused to rise above a hush, and yet there was something vibrating...calling almost into my very bones. A song of passage, a stonesfeel of home... </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">But whatever else it once held had been violently stolen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Deep gouges tore through the stone—long, chaotic, angry. The claw marks of something fierce. They didn’t follow the flow of the path—they slashed across it, as if the thing that made them refused to respect its purpose. Scratches scarred the walls, some blackened with soot, others split by weapons or other tools of destruction. The smell of scorched minerals lingered faintly, beneath the dust and smoky ice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">My breath puffed in great plumes as I moved. Each inhale filled my chest with the cold weight of history, and something else—something darker. Not a memory... A warning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl drifted beside me in silence now, the edge of her glow brushing faintly against the crystals as we passed. She said nothing. Perhaps she understood it too: that this wasn’t just a cave. It was a place that remembered being holy. And I resented what had been done to it. The enemy would pay with broken bones and split necks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I tightened my fists. My arms no longer ached. My legs no longer trembled. The mask had made my body strong.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">But even stronger was the pull to protect this place. This mountain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Let the monsters come.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I would meet them with stone and fire.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Yeeeah… I don’t like this," Tatl muttered at my side, her voice tinny and uneasy. "This place puts me on edge. It just feels like something is waiting to ambush us… Link, don’t you think you should take that mask off now?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"No," I rumbled, slower this time. "I like it. I need it, Tatl."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>I pushed forward with forceful strides, daring anything in the dark to try me. My shoulders rolled with power. I would defend my brothers. I </span>
      <span class="c8">was</span>
      <span class="c3"> the mountain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Ratt’s voice crept up behind me, low and cautious.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"This is the proving ground filled with monsters?" he asked, scanning the gouged cavern walls. "Well… at least this place is somewhat warm."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I hadn’t even noticed. It was warm—but something felt wrong. Like the dying embers of a once roaring inferno. The rock under my feet was solid, grounding. Good. But I still felt the wrongness. It was as though the mountain’s heart was locked in a quiet battle—its sacred pulse faintly whispering beneath the dark corruption that smothered it. The very air felt like a prayer gone unanswered, a temple forgotten by the gods.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">My brothers fell in line behind me as I walked the path forward. Several of them removed glowing crystal rods from their packs, illuminating their paths forward in the dim light. They were just as uneasy, their faces stretched with worry and fear as their heavy footsteps synced with mine. The fairy and the kid followed too. The glow ahead was red—firelight. But something inside me knew this place was sick… not right.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">We walked for a time. The quiet thrum of heat hummed through the floor, through my feet, through my bones. I listened to the vibration… felt pulse of mountain. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Would crush enemy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Eyes forward, smash threat…</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">And then—</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Link, take that mask off now! It’s been too long!” Tatl shrieked suddenly, darting in front of my face. “You’re losing it!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Her voice stabbed like a jolt. I blinked. Slowed. The world felt… dimmer somehow. Heavier. But her wings shimmered like memory. My fingers twitched toward face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Wrong. Something was wrong. The fairybug was right… I was too deep. Not safe. Take off. I reached up, gripped my beard.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">And pulled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The transformation ripped through me like being cracked open by a hammer. Stone sloughed from my body in an unseen avalanche. My limbs shrank. My chest caved inward. My thoughts flooded back in a rush, tangled and sharp. Pain flared through my whole body as if it had imploded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Uughnn… that… that didn’t feel great…” I choked, collapsed onto my hands and knees. My breath came out in shudders.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The air remained cool, but the heat beneath my palms surged like buried embers—too raw, too alive for bare skin to hold.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu’s voice called out, echoing faintly through the corridor. “Rhomar Link, are you well?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I pressed a hand to my chest, feeling it rise and fall like a stranger’s. The heat throbbed against my skin. My heart thundered in my ears.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“I-I’m… uhh… I’m fine, Elder,” I managed, my voice thinner now. “Just… trying to get used to it, is all.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I tried to stand. My legs were weak. Ratt was already there, his hands around my shoulders, grounding me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Easy,” he whispered, worry on his breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I steadied myself, shook my head once, scarlet hair whisking from my vision, and gently tapped his hand to remove it from my shoulder. He let go too quickly, as if afraid he’d done something wrong. His face darkened with guilt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I looked away, jaw clenched.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c8">Idiot, </span>
      <span>I cursed myself</span>
      <span class="c12 c23 c8">. I am an IDIOT.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The mask beckoned me like an old, dangerous friend as I placed the stone features on my belt, next to my Hero’s Mask—comforting in their familiarity, seductive in those promises of strength without pain. But every heartbeat echoed with Tatl’s fear, reminding me how easily I could lose myself, swallowed whole by the mountain’s fury or a warrior’s pride.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The others caught up to us, the ground quivering as they drew near. The stony faces of the Draumorim softened slightly as they watched me, their gazes filled not only with expectation, but quiet reverence—acknowledging the sacrifice, and silently promising to share the burden. Boromu shuffled in with his cane making solid thuds on the stone, parting through the line towards the cart with his slumbering son. The young Goron who stood at my height, pushed the cart more easily now across the smoother cavern floor towards the Elder, though his wide eyes betrayed his fear. The crystal glow painted his cheeks in soft blue as he glanced around the darkened chamber, clearly uneasy. He had probably never set foot in the Flame Hollows before.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Tumar, has Maro stirred?” Boromu asked gently, his voice as tired as the wind dying within the gate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“No, Elder… he has been as silent as the mountain,” Tumar answered, his tone subdued. His voice lacked the gravel and depth of the older warriors, but it carried a quiet strength of its own.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“I feared so…” Boromu murmured, his gaze lingering on the boy sleeping in the cart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Around us, the others were catching their breath, their broad shoulders rising and falling like bellows. Many leaned against the cave walls, eyes closed, arms slack. The imminent threat of freezing to death over, the silence of the corrupted halls was beginning to seep into their bones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu turned slowly to me, his heavy footsteps echoing against the etched floor. His faded eyes held both worry and weariness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Rhomar Link,” he said, “we must rest. We will need all of our strength for the trials ahead. I fear the mountain’s heart grows still beneath Goht’s corruption. And I sense… we are not alone here.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">A tremor passed through his voice—small, but it reached me. Even Boromu, ancient and tempered as he was, felt it: the presence that lingered, like a wrong note echoing through sacred halls.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Up ahead,” he continued, “there is a chamber of meditation, used by our young as the first rite to connect with sacred Snowhead. We can seal ourselves within. It will offer sanctuary to rest in peace.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">He lifted his cane and gestured down the corridor, his expression solemn.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“We will stop there for a time. Regain our strength. As we are now, we are no match for the shadows that stalk these halls.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I nodded, grateful for the pause. My arms ached from the weight of my form, and the hunger gnawed at me like an echo in my gut. . I vaguely wondered if I was able to eat rock as in Goron form—or if I’d even want to try—but the thought passed quickly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">We pressed onward.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The silence in the halls deepened with every step, broken only by the soft rattle of wheels and the distant hiss of cooling lava veins. The mountain no longer roared. It whispered. And the whisper was wrong.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The passages widened into vast, echoing caverns veined with molten arteries. But what should have been a roaring forge of life felt... wrong. I could feel the heat—yes—but it was uneven, unfocused. Not a broiling heart of a mountain… but something strangled. Something decaying.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Rivers of once-living lava crawled in sluggish streams along the channels, their surface crusted in flaky obsidian scabs. The color was all wrong—no fierce gold, no blazing red. Only a muted, muddy orange glimmered through the fractures. The veins pulsed faintly beneath the cracked stone like a heart trying to remember how to beat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">It felt like walking through the ribcage of a god that had recently stopped breathing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Boromu furrowed his brow, placing an ancient hand on one of the walls. His stone-scarred fingers brushed the blackened surface, reverent and mournful.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"This place once roared with heat," he muttered grimly. "Now it fades like a dying heart. The corruption reaches far here… even the breath of Vah Kel’Darah grows shallow."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Behind us, the Draumorim walked slower now. Their proud frames dimmed by something more than weariness—grief. Their gaze wandered not forward, but upward, to the stalactites and carved reliefs that once marked this as sacred ground. The loss wasn’t just physical—it was spiritual.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Even Tatl said nothing. She drifted onto my shoulder like ash on cooling coals, her glow dimmed. She didn’t fidget. She didn’t tease. She only rested there, quiet and watchful.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Not far now. We will rest at the next chamber. Let’s move, my brothers. Time for mourning will come later," the elder sighed, a long landslide of a breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I swallowed the tightness in my throat and pressed on, taking the lead again. Sweat beaded on my temples, but I didn’t complain. I welcomed the heat, no matter how strange it felt in here. It was better than the strength-sapping blizzard outside. It felt… earned. If nothing else, it reminded me I was still alive. Still moving.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The shadows danced against the walls with every ripple of failing magma. Somewhere deep in the rock, I thought I heard it—like a groan. A low, vibrating sorrow. The kind of sound stone makes when it’s trying not to break.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">As we passed under a steep archway with a familiar symbol of an eye and teardrop carved above it elegant, flowing lines. That symbol had always meant hidden truth, sacred witness. But here, it felt like a cry frozen in stone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">We ran into a solid obsidian door, flawless and lightless, absorbing the flickering glow around us. Elder Boromu took out the sacred Eye of Truth from his waist satchel, his hands steady despite the tremble in the air. He held it up to his faded vision, the lens catching the light in a single flash. After a moment of searching, he placed his ancient hand on the smooth obsidian.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">A pulse. A soft ripple of blue light shimmered outward from his palm like water disturbed in a bowl. With a low, resonant grinding of stone against stone, the door began to rise, vanishing into shadow above us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The air inside shifted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">It was cooler in here. Not the life-giving warmth of fire, but the heavy, dormant pressure of something long buried. The walls arched into a high dome, and the ceiling had been carved and painted with faded murals—spirals of snow and ice, rising flame and heat, figures of Goron pilgrims bowing before the mountain. Life flowing abundantly in a continuous arc from the heart of the mountains. On top of a the tallest peak stood a lone figure of an animal... yet not quite animal. It almost looked like a machine or statue of a four legged beast of burden. A quiet reverence lingered here, dulled by time but not yet erased.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">In each corner of the chamber stood what looked to be Sheikah Stones, but larger—shaped like seated Gorons. Their broad shoulders and thick arms were stylized into the stone itself, each one wearing a mask adorned with the Eye and Teardrop. But the shape was different—sharper, angular, echoing Goron craftsmanship. The ancient alliance made manifest in stone. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">These statues almost felt... awake.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">There was a sense—just beneath hearing. A pulse in the rock. The silence here was not mere quiet—it felt sacred, mournful, like a held breath in a room of silent prayers. The stone walls, etched with memories of devotion, seemed to whisper softly of hope still flickering, though buried deep beneath sorrow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“We will rest here, Rhomar Link,” Boromu said quietly, as if speaking too loudly would disturb the slumbering spirits carved into the stone. He turned, eyes shadowed. “Gromi, take Korozi and Belgor, and ensure the doors ahead are sealed.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Yes, Elder.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Gromi—the towering brother who had once dragged me into their camp—grunted low and signaled two others. Without a word, they moved into the corridor beyond, the glow of their crystals bobbing like will-o'-the-wisps before vanishing into the dark. The sound of stone groaning shut came soon after, echoing like a distant memory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I let out a breath I hadn’t known I was holding. The stillness was thick but not dead. It was watching.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“It is done, Elder. Korozi, set up camp, everyone gets rations.” Gromi’s voice rumbled low like rolling boulders. He turned toward me, his face weathered but earnest. “Rhomar, it may not be very tasty for humans, but we do have a type of bread that you both may be able to stomach if you are hungry. It’s important that you all keep up your strength. The path only gets more brutal ahead. Especially for a human.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">My stomach gave a sharp pang at the mention of food… I must have been far hungrier than I realized now that we had a moment of peace and safety.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Thank you,” I said, bowing my head slightly. “I’m sure your food will be just fine. I appreciate the generosity.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Gromi nodded once with a quiet grunt and turned to help the others. The Draumorim moved with quiet efficiency—despite their size, there was grace in how they handled the space. Belgor unrolled thick hide mats from a weathered pack, each marked with geometric red-and-black patterns. Korozi, stocky and broad-chested with an intricately braided beard ringed in bits of obsidian, tended to a small campfire built within a carved stone basin, stoking it with chunks of slow-burning coal that hissed faintly as they caught. The air smelled of mineral smoke and warm earth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tumar hovered near the cart, his young face tight with anxiety. He kept stealing glances at the mural above, then back to the older Gorons, his posture stiff with the pressure of expectation. Though his limbs still carried the weight of youth, he held himself as tall as he could, as though his spine alone could carry the honor of the tribe. Maro remained as still as a boulder in the cart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl poked her head out from my cloak, her glow dim but steady. "That bread better not be made of rocks. I swear if it cracks my teeth, I’m going to scream."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Ratt let out a soft laugh, wiping any frost that lingered from his cheeks and hair. "After that hike? I’d chew a tree stump if it came with salt."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Haha Tatl, you don't even eat! Why would you care?" I laughed and gave her a playful tap with a finger.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Hey I eat! You just never notice. I don't need as much as you huge lumbering humans." Tatl rolled her eyes and pushed my finger away gently.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I smiled, the weariness briefly softened by their banter. A portlier Goron named Dolmi—his arms tattooed with silver spiral bands and his eyes almost comically large—handed out dense, clay-colored loaves from a leather pack. The scent was earthy and faintly sweet, like roasted chestnuts and ash.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Ratt took his with a skeptical glance. "Looks like a rock. Smells like a rock. Here goes nothing."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">He bit in—and blinked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Okay that’s… not bad actually. Kinda nutty. And spicy?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Mountain pepper-root," Dolmi rumbled helpfully. "Grows in the ashfall. Warms the chest."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Tatl took a hesitant nibble from mine, then widened her eyes in surprise. "Well, paint me surprised. Not bad for boulder bread."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I settled down beside Ratt on one of the thick hides. Heat curled around us in gentle waves, cocooning us momentarily in a peaceful, almost sacred hush.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The Gorons moved slower now, exhaustion beginning to catch them. Gromi sat against the far wall, arms crossed, his heavy lids fluttering as if in meditation. Korozi rubbed at his knees and murmured something in a rhythmic chant, the words low and ancient, like stones grinding underwater. Even Belgor, stoic and thick as a gatehouse, took a seat and traced an old carving on the stone floor with a calloused finger, lost in thought.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">In the corners of the room, the ancient Sheikah-Goron effigies still watched, their silent masks reflecting the firelight and crystal rods with a dull gleam. Faint vibrations still hummed from within them—steady, patient, as though waiting for someone to speak the right word.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I watched them. This wasn’t just a rest—it was mourning. This place, once sacred, had been defiled. Their silence wasn’t just tiredness. It was grief. A quiet vigil for something they all felt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I decided to take a chunk of the hard loaf. The crust cracked apart like a soft clay brick, flaking gently in my gloved hands. The inside was dense—spongy like moss and a deep volcanic gray. I took an experimental nibble. Surprisingly, it was tasty, with a hint of oaky spice and a slow-burning heat that bloomed across my tongue. I took a bigger mouthful, and my stomach growled in gratitude. The bread was heavy and tough, almost like dried meat, and every chew fed something deeper than just my body. It reminded me of hearth smoke and old forest bark—simple, honest things.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Beside me, Ratt had gone quiet. He chewed slower, distracted, then began to hum.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The tune floated gently out of him, soft and sorrowful—a lullaby woven from glass and elegance. Each note drifted like currents in still water, brushing against the edges of memory like wind through an old curtain. It was beautiful in its simplicity, ancient in its grace. My breath hitched, caught on the edge of recognition.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I knew that melody.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Not the name. Not the shape of it. But something inside me stirred—like a memory half-frozen, beginning to thaw.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I turned to him, my brow furrowed. "Where did you learn that song? It sounds… familiar. What is it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">He blinked, startled by the question. "Oh. Uh… I dunno, actually. It’s just… been in my head since yesterday. Just lingering in the back of my mind... You know?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I nodded slowly, the ache in my chest returning, I felt like I was forgetting something vitally important.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Interesting… I swear I’ve heard it before… somewhere…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Ratt looked down at the bread in his lap. His fingers were still now. He spoke more quietly, like he was speaking to himself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"It makes me feel… sad. Like this place. Like something old was lost here. I don’t know why, I just… felt like it was right to hum. Like it belonged here. Something royal and noble to sing into this place."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I swallowed the lump in my throat with another bite of bread. "Sing it again," I said, voice hoarse. "Please. I don’t know why, but… it’s calming. I need to hear it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">One of the brothers passed around a large heavy stone flask, and I took it with both hands and swallowed a mouthful of pure, fresh spring water. I passed it to Ratt, and he smiled with a flicker of something solemn behind his usual smirk. After a few swallows of the revitalising water, he began to hum again—this time louder, surer. Each note lingered like a quiet echo, curling gently around memories buried too deep to face. I felt the ache of her absence, the gentle sadness of a goodbye left unfinished. The lullaby wrapped around me, soft as snowfall, warm as tears. The Draumorim turned their heads, listening with eyes closed, reverent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The sound moved through the chamber like water rippling upward. It didn’t just echo—it filled the space. Sank into the bones of the stone. A melody of peace, but not without pain. It felt like starlight in winter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">A name surfaced in my mind. Just barely.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">When Ratt finished, he let out a breath and whispered—barely audible, but I caught it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Zelda."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">My hand froze. My entire body went still.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Wait," I said sharply, turning to face him fully. "How do you know that name?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Ratt’s eyes widened. "What name? Zelda?" He hesitated, clearly uncertain. "I… don’t know. I just think of that name when I hear that song. It fits. Like a memory trying to come through a fog. Why, who is Zelda? Do you know them?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">My mouth went dry. I looked into the flickering firelight and saw her—not her face, not exactly. Just the shape of what we’d shared. The ache of walking away from it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"She…" I paused, searching for words that didn’t exist to describe how I was feeling. "She was a princess I once saved. We were close. Maybe more than close. But I chose to leave. I couldn’t—" I faltered. The truth was heavier than I expected. "Ugh… nevermind. It’s in the past."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Ratt looked at me carefully. Not with pity. Just understanding.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"You… couldn’t be satisfied in a time of peace," he said gently. "There was too much pain."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The words hit like a hammer to the chest. My eyes widened—not in anger, but in raw, unguarded shock.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">How could he see that?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">He shouldn’t have been able to. Not unless… he felt the same way somehow?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The firelight flickered between us, casting long shadows that danced across the ancient stone walls. Around the chamber, the low murmurs of the Gorons had faded into the hush of rest, but between me and Ratt, something raw and electric still lingered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I looked down at my hands—slender, with fine wrists and graceful fingers, delicate in a way that I still wasn't used to. The fingerless brown gloves clung tightly to my skin, worn and weathered from the road. A Hero... That title meant less and less with every step into this frozen, cursed land. But somehow—here, now—his words made it feel less like a wound and more like a scar. Something that had bled… but was now starting to heal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">For a breath of a pause, I couldn’t speak. The fire crackled softly beside us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">And for the first time in a very long while, I felt like someone finally understood.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">"Y… yeah," I finally whispered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">It was all I could say.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">And somehow, in the echo of that quiet, it was enough.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The heaviness of the chamber and memory weighed on me, and I took a final bite of my portion of Goron bread, chewing it in silence. The flavor lingered—smoky, nutty, warm. It clung to my mouth like the heat of the fire still radiating from the center of the room. I held it there, letting the comfort settle as if to anchor me in the now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Alright, well if you two are done making out, I’m gonna get some sleep,” Tatl grumbled in irritation, fluttering off my shoulder in a blur of white gold. She curled into a glowing ball on the nearest bedroll, her wings twitching faintly like the last flickers of a firefly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I frowned at her, exhaling with a slow sigh. The weight in my chest hadn’t lifted—if anything, it had simply rearranged itself. I swallowed the last of my bread and rose to my feet, moving toward the bedroll beside her. The stone beneath me felt colder now, even with the chamber’s residual warmth pressing into my skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I wasn’t tired. Not even close. The memory had shaken me loose. My mind was racing with too much I couldn’t untangle—anger, longing, sorrow, fear. All of it mixing in my blood like coals refusing to die out. This meditation chamber, carved for peace and self-reflection, only amplified what I was already carrying. It didn’t soothe me. It made everything louder.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">“Yeah, that’s a good idea. I haven’t slept in days, it feels like,” Ratt said quietly after a long pause. His voice was softer than before, worn down by the day. He stood, brushing crumbs from his gloves, and walked slowly to a bedroll farther off.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">I watched him go. Just for a second. I didn’t want him to leave. I wanted him beside me—to feel his warmth again, to borrow just a little of the steadiness he always seemed to summon. But the pang of guilt twisted deeper. Anger followed it, and I shut my eyes hard against both.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">No. Not now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">We were still in danger. This place was still corrupted. And sleep—even restless, haunted sleep—was something I had to force if I wanted to stay strong enough to keep him... us... alive.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">So I lay back on the hide mat, my bare fingers curling against the stout leather, and willed myself to stillness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">The chamber sighed around us, deep and old.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c3">Somewhere beyond these walls, the mountain slowly died in silence.</span>
    </p>
