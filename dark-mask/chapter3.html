<p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As Tatl and I entered the next area, I cautiously took in my surroundings, preferring to avoid any more surprises. This room, or abyss I should say, was large and lit by only a few torches lining the walls. Great planks of trees rose up from unfathomable depths, and seemed to support the ceiling of the chamber. From the top of the chamber drooped many large root-like structures, so I assumed we were still beneath the forest. I cast my gaze back downward. From what I could gather from the sparse lighting, I noticed there was very little flooring here—a precarious lattice of wooden planks, some groaning softly beneath my weight as I advanced. I would really have to watch my step.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I began to plod forward with a determination to see the sky again. Tatl kept up with me, lighting the path with her faintly glowing form and we made it to the other side of the area with little difficulty. From this room expanded another hallway. I groaned in annoyance and asked Tatl how much further, being in no mood for games.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Only a bit further! We're almost into town, that's where the fountain is!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">And so I started walking into the hall when I suddenly tripped over my loose boot. Wait…loose boot? The thing had fit perfectly an hour ago! My heart skipped—was it shock, confusion, or something deeper? The loose fit felt like a quiet betrayal by my own body, a creeping unease curling through my gut. Did that damned Skull Kid put an age-regression spell on me? That would explain the cracking voice I guess.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Are you alright?" Tatl asked. "You seem to really be having a tough time moving around. You've been tripping all over the place since I first saw you!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No I'm not alright! Your friend put some -creak- kind of spell on me!" I shouted angrily. "What did he do?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She waved her hands in protest, "I had no idea his mask even had that aura ability. How should I know?" The tiny fairy shrugged.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She tried helping me up by tugging at my tunic. I got back to my feet and tightened the buckles on my boots. Hopefully this fairy knew what she was doing. I would hate to have to buy entirely new clothes, and it was doubtful I would find any Kokiri tailors anywhere near here. Yet at the rate I was going, it wouldn't be long before my tunic and white pants slipped right off.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I peered down the hallway, noticing how mechanical the surrounding walls appeared as gears turned slowly. The shift was jarring—a stark, metallic world of ticking gears and oiled steel replacing the organic hush of the forest. It was strangely comforting, but also alien, like stepping into the hollowed-out chest of some vast mechanical beast. The contrast unsettled me more than I expected, and yet, mechanical devices meant civilization. And civilization meant that Tatl was telling the truth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">As we passed through the clockwork hall, the gears began to turn faster. I noticed a heavy-looking metal door up ahead. I brushed the bangs that fell into my eyes away to get a better look. Wait…..bangs? I didn't have bangs? I usually kept my hair trimmed—always short and tidy to stay out of my eyes, especially during battle. Soft strands brushed my forehead, golden and unfamiliar, stirring a flicker of unease in my chest. Had we really been down here long enough for my bangs to grow out? As I was pondering the possibilities of the passage of time, the large door fully opened with a loud, metallic groan. As if it hadn't been opened in ages...but that wasn't right? The Skull Kid had </span>
      <span class="c4">just</span>
      <span class="c0"> come through here!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c4">Maybe time really does get distorted in this place.</span>
      <span class="c0"> I thought.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I asked Tatl about the subject.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"No, he has a strange ability to move between realms. That's how he does most of his pranking actually." She explained.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, well that's just great. How am I supposed to even find him, then?" I signed dismay.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"The Great Fairy will know, she's very wise, and powerful! She'll know exactly what to do!" Tatl said in a hopeful tone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I glanced back at her, and the pixie smirked. But the smile was short lived and twisted into a faint grimace.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What's wrong?" I inquired, "Can the Great Fairy help me find him or not?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl tried to encourage me by grinning again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh totally! But we had better get there soon."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I grimly shook my head and let out a quiet huff of frustration, the mounting strangeness gnawing at my nerves. Every step, every change, every unanswered question—it was all becoming too much. And Tatl, for all her fluttering help, seemed to offer more riddles than relief. I shuffled through the entryway into a massive chamber of turning gears and pulleys. It looked as if we were in an enormous clock! A small stream ran through the center on the bottom floor where we stood, acting as the engine for the entire device as it turned a huge waterwheel. Sunlight streamed in through small windows on the upper floors, and I hoped that's where the exit would be. I noticed a flight of stairs to our left, so I headed that direction. Nearing the stairs, I noticed my tunic was starting to feel even more loose now, just like the boots.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I tightened my belt again, frowning as my fingers found far more slack than before. The leather resisted at first, then slid too easily—like it had been made for someone else entirely. It sagged lower on my hips than I remembered, the looseness stirring a quiet alarm beneath my skin. It wasn’t dramatic, but it was wrong. Subtle. Creeping. A growing mismatch between body and memory. I crouched to pick up my long, green hat, using the moment to adjust the boot straps again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I peered nervously at Tatl, who was doing her best to look more interested in the waterwheel, avoiding making eye contact with me. I decided to see what her hesitation was all about, noticing that the stream seemed smooth enough to give a somewhat decent reflection. So I walked to the edge nervously, unsure of what I would see, and nudged ever closer. As I leaned down, a lock of blonde hair fell over my eye, feather-light against my cheek. I jolted upright, startled, and let out a sharp, high-pitched squeak—so soft and foreign it made my heart skip.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">As the reflection formed in the slow-moving stream, I beheld my face—and a cold, crawling fear crept up my spine. For a heartbeat, I didn’t recognize the person staring back at me. There was something unfamiliar in the shape of my eyes, the softness of my jawline, as if my face were quietly shifting into someone else's. My breath caught, suspended between denial and dread, and I felt the world tilt ever so slightly. My eyes were undeniably a different color now—deeper, more vivid—and as I stared, the subtle softening of my features became impossible to ignore. My face looked younger, finer in structure, and unfamiliar in a way that made something tighten uncomfortably in my chest. The biggest difference, though, was my hair. Blond strands now reached the tip of my nose, drifting in front of my eyes like delicate silk. Without my cap to tame it, the change seemed even more dramatic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c4">And there’s nothing really wrong with me,</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> I told myself, clinging to the thought like a shield. </span>
      <span class="c4 c12">Other than the longer hair, that is. I'm fine. If anything, I’m only under a reverse-aging spell! I can deal with that.... I've conquered gigantic monsters as a child—I’ll defeat the Skull Kid as well!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I smiled optimistically—perhaps too optimistically—and proceeded to tighten my boots, dusting off my cap as I stood. The grin felt a bit strained, more armor than emotion, but I clung to it anyway as I climbed up the stairway, trying to convince myself that everything would be alright. On the second floor, I was relieved to see a large set of wooden doors that gently moved in the outside breeze.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok! Let's go already!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I jumped in surprise, forgetting about Tatl, who was waiting impatiently beside the exit. I still wasn't quite used to having another fairy companion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Alright, alright. I'm -squeak- coming!" I replied, ignoring the cracking of my voice as I headed for the big doors.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I stepped outside, shielding my eyes from the bright midmorning sun, and sighed with relief. </span>
      <span class="c4">Finally!</span>
      <span class="c0"> It felt like an eternity ago when last I saw the sun. I took a deep breath of fresh air and looked around, letting the warm and comforting rays of light soak into my skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I stood in the middle of a bustling plaza, where the murmur of voices mingled with the rhythmic clatter of boots on cobblestones. The warm scent of baked bread and dry timber wafted from nearby stalls, grounding me in this strange but vibrant world beyond the forest's shadow. Townsfolk bustled back and forth, weaving around construction workers who were steadily building up a tower of wooden scaffolding. I turned back toward the building we had just exited—and felt my breath hitch.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The tower loomed above us, taller than I had imagined. A true clock tower, its brick and mortar body stretched toward the heavens like a monument to time itself....watchful, ancient, uncaring. Its great arms pointed skyward, massive hands marking the hour with solemn grace, as if trying to clutch the sun right out of the sky.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My neck began to ache from staring up at the tower for so long. I finally tore my gaze away and turned back toward the busy construction crew. For a moment, something about them struck me as strangely familiar—like I’d seen their faces before, though I couldn’t place where. But I shook the thought off. I had no time to gawk or daydream.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl was already fluttering ahead, beckoning me with a sharp wave.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Come on! Hurry up! The Great Fairy is just this way!" she called, her voice rising above the din of the bustling plaza.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I followed her into the crowd, weaving between people, trying not to lose sight of her. The mass of moving bodies made me feel small—</span>
      <span class="c4">too</span>
      <span class="c0"> small. I’d faced giant beasts without flinching, but now every elbow, every jostle made me feel oddly fragile. Maybe it was because I’d lost my weapons. Or maybe it was something deeper.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We left the chaotic plaza behind and entered a quieter part of town. The change was immediate—and welcome. The noise faded, replaced by the whisper of leaves and the chirping of birds. We were in a peaceful park, where bright flowers bloomed in clusters and soft green grass shimmered beneath the midday sun. Trees stood like guardians, their shade offering cool relief from the warmth above. I longed to sit down, just for a moment—to rest, to breathe—but Tatl was already zipping toward the hill at the far end of the grove.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The hill rose gently among the trees, and a stone path led to a cave mouth nestled in its side. Smooth steps guided us upward, and I followed, casting one last glance at the calm of the park before slipping into the cool dark of the grotto.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Almost immediately, Tatl gave a cry of alarm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The cave opened into a glowing chamber centered around a fountain—a pool of pale, pulsing light. Fairies hovered above the water in a unified swirl, their wings shimmering with a soft pink hue. But something was off. These weren’t ordinary fairies. They moved in eerie unison, their colors uniform, as if they shared a single will. A hive-mind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span>“</span>
      <span class="c0">Great Fairy!” Tatl gasped, flying closer. “What happened to you?!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">In a hundred whispering voices, the swarm spoke as one:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c16">“</span>
      <span class="c12 c30 c6 c16">The Skull Kid has cast a terrible spell upon me. He shattered my essence. He must be stopped… at all costs.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Tatl gestured toward me with a hopeful flutter. “This one—he can help! He’s strong, I’ve seen what he can do!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The pink fairies swarmed me suddenly, circling close. I froze as they examined me with silent intensity.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c16">“</span>
      <span class="c6 c16 c42">Poor dear,”</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> the voices murmured. </span>
      <span class="c12 c6 c16 c30">“You too are touched by his corruption…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I nodded faintly, already feeling the weight of hopelessness pressing down. If the Skull Kid had shattered </span>
      <span class="c4">this</span>
      <span class="c0"> creature of light… what chance did I really have?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c16">“</span>
      <span class="c42 c6 c16">Restore me,”</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> they said in perfect unison. </span>
      <span class="c12 c30 c6 c16">“And I may be able to undo what’s been done. As I am now, I can only ease physical wounds. What afflicts you runs deeper than that.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I opened my mouth to respond, but the world began to tilt. My stomach churned. I stumbled back from the glow and staggered outside, clutching my midsection as nausea overtook me. The moment I hit the grass, the fire returned.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">It wasn’t heat like flame—it was </span>
      <span class="c4">something inside me</span>
      <span class="c0">, twisting and burning and reshaping. My spine arched with the pain as my muscles locked and convulsed. I curled into myself, the world blurring with tears as I bit down on my sleeve to keep from screaming.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My bones ground together. My chest tightened. My head pounded like a Goron drum being beaten by giants. And then—silence. The pain stopped as abruptly as it had begun, leaving behind only tremors and ragged breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I lay there, gasping for air, my vision swimming. Tatl hovered above me, her soft light flickering with worry. She drew close, and I caught the faint intake of breath as she stared at me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">A chill ran through me. Something in her expression said everything I needed to know—whatever had just happened… it was worse than I feared.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I didn’t move. Couldn’t move. I simply lay in the grass, limbs limp, staring up at the blue sky I longed to see earlier...trying to make sense of the impossible thing happening to my body, to my </span>
      <span class="c4">self</span>
      <span class="c0">.</span>
