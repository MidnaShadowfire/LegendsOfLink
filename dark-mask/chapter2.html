      <span class="c7 c6">What seemed like an eternity passed as I painfully stumbled along after my stolen horse, heart pounding with a heady mix of desperation and rising panic. Every dragging step felt like a silent cry—one part anger, one part fear—that I might never see Epona or my ocarina again. Thankfully the sleepy forest received minimal foot traffic, and Epona's trail was fairly simple to follow. My legs, though battered and sliced beyond recognition, managed to carry me to a series of massive tree trunks. It was here where the clear trail ended, but I was </span>
      <span class="c4">not</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> going to give up on Epona, or my ocarina. They were beyond priceless to me now. I just </span>
      <span class="c4">had</span>
      <span class="c0"> to get them back!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Thinking I'd get a better view atop one of the tree trunks, I forced myself to clamber up the tallest one. Reaching the top and gasping for breath, with my entire body in agony, I observed my surroundings. Aside from the usual lethargy of the forested atmosphere, I managed to spot a cave where several horse tracks led to. The cave looked as if it was carved into a tree that stood a short distance away, it </span>
      <span class="c4">had</span>
      <span class="c0"> to be their hideout! Thankfully it was much easier to climb down...er...fall down… than it was to struggle up the imposing trunk, but I made it. I crawled my way to the entrance, totally exhausted at this point. I had no idea what I was going to do in this state, I could barely move my arm let alone swing my sword! But, being the stubborn lad I was, I made my way into the cavern despite my injuries. The darkness of the cave enveloped me like a wet shroud, the scent of damp earth and rotting wood clinging to my nose as I stepped into the void. I couldn't make out anything—the blackness pressed in on all sides, thick and suffocating, as if the air itself were holding its breath. I fumbled around the floor, forcing myself to plod forward, when suddenly I was falling!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c4">Greeeaaaaat... </span>
      <span class="c7 c6">I thought. So much effort and pain just to fall to my death. </span>
      <span class="c4 c12">FANTASTIC!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I glanced down, trying to see the very bottom of the pit, but it was swallowed in darkness. A hollow wind howled past my ears as I dropped, accompanied by faint, ghostly echoes that bounced off unseen walls. The rush of air tore at my tunic and made my eyes water, adding a raw chill to the pit's growing dread. This must have been an incredibly deep hole, as I had been falling seemingly for a few seconds. But my thoughts of doom were interrupted by a pinpoint of light below me. As I prepared myself for the crushing blow of the floor below, the tiny dot multiplied into many dots, and then those dots became pictures. I was suddenly falling through faces! Faces upon faces stared me down—some familiar, others twisted into grotesque parodies of memory, their eyes wide and hollow, expressions frozen in masks of sorrow, fury, or vacant indifference. Either due to this new development, or from overwhelming pain, my vision darkened and I drifted into unconsciousness...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I had no notion of how much time had passed, but I was cast out of my comatose state by the feeling of a soft thud against a spongy substance. I opened my eyes slowly and saw that I was no longer falling through empty space. The padded flooring I had landed on was in fact a large, purple flower that had the faint scent of blueberries. All around me, the chamber glowed faintly with a surreal, bioluminescent sheen—the walls pulsing with veins of soft green and lavender light. Strange, twisted plants grew from every angle, some bearing softly humming bulbs, others blooming with hypnotic patterns that shifted like oil on water. The air was warm and slightly sweet, tinged with something earthy and ancient.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I gently pulled myself to my feet, bracing for the sharp sting of torn muscles and scraped skin—but nothing came. My breath caught as confusion swept in. Where I expected agony, there was only eerie ease. For a moment, I just stood there, stunned, warily flexing my fingers and shifting my weight, half-expecting the pain to lunge out belatedly like a hidden trap. To my surprise I felt fine! I looked down at my body to realize I had been completely healed! Not only that, but my green-colored Kokiri tunic and white pants had been fully restored as well. I was still disoriented from the fall, and could barely remember a thing.... Just when I began imagining that I was dead and in the afterlife, bright lights flooded the chamber, temporarily blinding me. I covered my eyes against the sudden brilliance and heard a voice. The same scratchy, childlike voice that I remember stealing...something... from me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Whew, what is with your stupid horse?! It wouldn't listen to a thing I said!" The voice taunted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Suddenly, everything came flooding back to me—Epona! My Ocarina! The memory struck like a lightning bolt, sending a jolt of panic and grief surging through my chest. My breath caught as images of her wide, terrified eyes and the flash of the stolen ocarina tore through my mind. It was all real—and they were gone. The lights dimmed slightly and there, menacingly floating above the ground a few meters away, was the Skull Kid. The two fairies were with him, but where was Epona? I gazed around the grotto in desperation, but my mare was nowhere in sight. All that could be seen, aside from the thieves, was a tiny pond between us, and a few cave sketches carved into the walls. Other than that, it was an empty room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Where is she!" I growled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What? There's no need of a disobedient horse, so I did you a favor and got rid of her!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I blinked in disbelief. Epona? </span>
      <span class="c4">Gone</span>
      <span class="c0">? I clenched my armored fists in rage.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"NOOOO!" I shouted. "You're going to regret ever meeting me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I drew my sword and shield. This creature was going to pay for what he had done! I was at full health now... there was no way I would lose to him this time. He was cornered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oooooo looks like we got a tough guy!" The Skull Kid proclaimed. "What do you fairies think?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The fairies had no chance to respond, I darted forward, aiming to plunge my blade through the Skull Kid's mask. The child howled a malicious laugh, and suddenly my sword transformed into a large tulip and my shield shattered into a powdery cloud. Taken aback, I stumbled and tripped over myself, landing in the shallow water that separated me from the masked skull child.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"HA! You think you can take me as I am now? You think a big, strong man like you can stop me?" Skull Kid said in a threatening tone. "Well...we'll see about that!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I quickly leapt to my feet, searching in the water for something I could use as a weapon. From the corner of my eye, I saw the strange, heart-shaped mask begin to emit a strange purple aura. I attempted to dodge aside, assuming he was about to throw some kind of magic bolt at me, but I couldn't move, my legs were paralyzed! The translucent purple aura had begun to surround me, and I feared that the worst was about to happen and I would be soon joining my ancestors.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The aura slowly closed in around me, encasing my body in its glow. Suddenly ice cold, ethereal tendrils surged from the aura and wrapped tightly around my body. The air thickened, tasting like syrupy rot, and I began to smell a pungently sweet odor as the ghostly tendrils writhed around my form. I felt an intense burning sensation, like something was boiling me from within, reshaping me from the soul outward! Tears of pain welled up inside my eyes as the fiery sensation swarmed over me, overtaking not just my body, but something deeper—my very essence. The ghostly strands pierced into my being, twisting and churning my spirit, dragging something foreign to the surface. I could feel things changing—my balance, my center of gravity, the very way my limbs responded, as if they no longer obeyed quite the same way. The pain became more than physical—it was existential, like I was being unmade. I cried out, the sound lost in the pulse of dark energy surrounding me. Just when I thought I would vanish entirely, the pain stopped. The purple aura withdrew, leaving me gasping on my knees. My lungs clawed at the air. I felt off...wrong...lighter, somehow—but wrong in a way I couldn't yet name.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Heeheeheehee! Take </span>
      <span class="c4">that</span>
      <span class="c0">!" The imp cackled, laced with something deeper than cruelty...something ancient and wrong. "That'll teach you to threaten me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">I once again began grasping around the shallow water looking for a stone, a fish, </span>
      <span class="c4">anything </span>
      <span class="c0">to throw at the Skull Kid while he laughed at me. My vision wobbled, but I managed to grasp a decent sized rock and got to my feet, throwing it straight for the heart-shaped mask. The rock smashed into the mask, which cracked faintly at the edge with a pulse of dark light, and the Skull Kid shrieked in pain. The mask seemed to absorb part of the blow, its surface momentarily rippling as if alive, and a low hum of energy thrummed through the air like a warning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Yeeaarrrghhh! You'll pay for that!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The ground suddenly began to shake, and losing my balance I fell back into the shallow water. I felt weak, off balance, and I could hardly stand! The Skull Kid nervously looked around.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Uughh. You're lucky, I have more important things to deal with right now. I'll finish you off later! You'll be </span>
      <span class="c4">much </span>
      <span class="c0">easier to get rid of by then!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">He began retreating toward the sketched-upon wall, and it opened upward like a door. I rose to my feet and began chasing after him, when the white fairy attacked me. Momentarily distracted, I managed to push the offending fairy away and get back to my pursuit, when the door suddenly slammed shut! This shocked the fairy, and it thankfully stopped attacking me as it rushed over to the door.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"H-hey! Skull Kid wait up!" The tiny white fairy shouted. "Don't leave me behind!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">There was no answer and the female fairy twinkled in despair. I felt a twinge of pity for her, but only for a split-second. She was an accomplice to an atrocious act on top of aiding the Skull Kid in robbing me. I ignored her pleas for the Skull Kid to come back, gathering my wits and trying to figure out why I felt so strange. I knelt down next to the pond to splash some water on my face when I saw my reflection. My eyes looked more of an aqua color now instead of the pale blue I remembered, but that was all I could see that was different about me. I shrugged it off, thinking that the water had discolored the appearance of my eyes. I stood back up and looked to the now crying fairy. A flood of emotions churned beneath the surface—was this justice? Pity? Some part of me wanted to hate her for what she'd done, yet another part saw only a lost creature, abandoned and afraid. I wasn't sure what I felt, only that the rage had started to cool—and something else, something quieter, was taking its place.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The pixie turned to face me and exclaimed that she was now separated from her brother, and how it was all my fault. I shot her an irritated glance and walked up to the door. I put my hands on it and began to push up. I had done this a million times before and it was no problem for me. At least, in the past it wasn't difficult. But now I was struggling to even lift it up a couple feet. My arms trembled, my muscles ached... and something felt off in how my limbs moved. My center of gravity seemed...wrong, slightly shifted. That aura the Skull Kid's mask generated must have sapped my strength! But despite this, I managed to get the door just high enough for me to slip through. The fairy, seeing an opportunity to escape the musty chamber, followed suit. Still, I ignored her, and continued down a long wooden corridor. It appeared as if I was walking through a tree...which made sense. I did fall through a hole in a tree, so why not? I was willing to believe anything at this point. The air smelled faintly of bark and decay—ancient, damp, and earthy. As I neared the end of the wooden hallway, the fairy came huffing and puffing after me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Wait! Are... whew... are you just going to leave me behind?" she panted, "You can't leave a poor, defenseless fairy like me to fend for myself!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I looked at her and responded with a spiteful snicker.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Defenseless, eh? What was all that with attacki- </span>
      <span class="c4">squeak</span>
      <span class="c0">"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My voice cracked, sharp and high-pitched like a child’s. The fairy gave me a strange look. I cleared my throat and began again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Attacking me? And why should I help </span>
      <span class="c4">you</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> at all? You've been </span>
      <span class="c4">nothing</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> but trou- </span>
      <span class="c4">crack</span>
      <span class="c0">"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">Once again my voice squeaked, painfully so. What was </span>
      <span class="c4">wrong</span>
      <span class="c0"> with me?! There was a strange tightness in my throat now, like something foreign and unyielding had taken root.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The fairy kept giving me that odd look, but after a second she started begging again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Please please </span>
      <span class="c4">please</span>
      <span class="c0"> let me come with you! I promise to tell you all I know about the Skull Kid!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I considered her offer, mulling it over in my head. On one hand, she could be a big help. On the other hand, I wasn't sure if I could trust her. But the pros outweighed the cons, and I nodded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Alright you can come. But if you try anything, you are throu- </span>
      <span class="c4">creak</span>
      <span class="c0">…?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I coughed in frustration. It felt as if there was a tiny, smooth object lodged in my vocal cords. I kept coughing, trying to clear the obstruction. It would not budge. I pressed a gauntleted hand to my throat and leaned my forehead against the cool, wooden wall of the hallway. My whole body trembled—not from pain, but something more unsettling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Are you okay?" the fairy asked gently. "You seem a little distraught?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c4">Distraught? Seriously?</span>
      <span class="c7 c6"> I thought bitterly. </span>
      <span class="c4 c12">I had been robbed, dragged through the forest floor, plummeted to my supposed death, and who knew what else was wrong with me... and she says DISTRAUGHT!?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She must have seen the look on my face, because she started apologizing almost immediately.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I'm sorry! I-I never meant for this to go so far!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The fairy glanced away, and her demeanor shifted, lowering her voice almost to a whisper... as if she was trying to convince herself as well.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"The Skull Kid didn't use to be so cruel...i-it was all meant to be a simple prank, I swear..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"A simple prank? Killing my horse—</span>
      <span class="c4">squeak</span>
      <span class="c0">—was a simple prank?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The squeaking voice was grating on my nerves. The strange pressure in my throat grew tighter, like an invisible hand slowly wrapping around it. It was most likely due to all the trauma my body and mind had endured... but I wasn’t so sure anymore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You can't tell me it was a prank…" I said in a weary tone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok, ok, look. I will help you out with a whole bunch of things. You sound really tired, understandably…" the pixie reasoned out, attempting to bargain. "I know where a nearby fountain is. You can get help from the Great Fairy there. And if anyone can help you right now with the Skull Kid, it's the Great Fairy!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c7 c6">"Fine. Show me where, and you can tag along." I finally gave in. A fairy fountain was </span>
      <span class="c4">exactly</span>
      <span class="c0"> what I needed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Awesome! You won't regret it, I promise! My name's Tatl. What's yours?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Link," I sighed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Ok great! Nice to meet you... and sorry again…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I refused to respond as we crossed the threshold into the next room.</span>
