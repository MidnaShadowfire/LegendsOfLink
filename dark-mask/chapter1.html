    <p class="c24">
      <span class="c0">The forest was oddly still and silent. There were no signs of scurrying woodland creatures, nor were there any whispers of a single breeze rustling through the trees. It was as if the land was under some sort of spell, cast into a dreamlike sleep. The very air itself, still as death. The massive trees transformed the bright, noon sunlight into a soft gloom. Looking around, I could see no living thing, aside from the lethargic trees, and I grew doubtful that I would ever find a way out of these woods.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I had been traveling with Epona, my faithful horse, in these seemingly endless woods for the past few days. I truly hoped I would be at the edge soon, and riding into the next kingdom. Or whatever lands lay beyond Hyrule, that is. Not many Hylians had been outside of Hyrule proper, let alone this deep within the Laost Woods...if we even were in the Lost Woods for that matter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Epona continued to trot along at a relaxed gait, not a care in the world. I rubbed a gauntleted hand along her white mane, grateful that she was wit me. Epona shook her light brown head and whinnied happily, her white speckled nose bobbing in delight. I could tell that she was enjoying this easy canter through the serene forest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I chuckled at my companion, giving her another pat on head. Epona had been a close friend since the day we met, and I was very thankful that she joined me on this new adventure. Who knew how long I'd have been stuck in this place without her. Weeks? Months?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I took another lazy glance around to see if anything changed. Nothing new, nothing in the distance but towering trees and placid, almost suffocating forest air. We were seemingly all alone, and there wasn't a single soul in sight. I began to get drowsy with the combination of Epona's gentle strides and boredom, the environment lulling me into deep sleep. I shut my eyes and began to dream of Zelda, and of our last conversation before I left Hyrule...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The castle garden was bright and cheerful, flowers splashed vibrant colors amongst the white castle walls and green grass. Statues dotted the area, immortalizing valiant heroes and noble kings. In the middle of the garden stood a grand effigy of the three Hylian Goddesses Farore, Nayru, and Din. Above their heads rose the Triforce, the magnificent gift the Goddesses gave the world before they departed to the next realm. It was because of the Triforce that I was thrust into my destiny.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I was the Hero of Time, a child bound to the fate of the land. A child destined to fight the greatest evil that had ever befallen Hyrule, the self proclaimed King of Evil, Ganondorf. After a perilous, lengthy, and exhausting adventure, I had won. Following the battle, I met with a fully grown Zelda one last time. We were adults at that time, because I had to travel through time itself to defeat the wicked Gerudo lord, but I still had the mind of a child. Zelda and I stood there on the ruined remains of what was once Ganon's immense fortress. The wind was howling, and dust flew all around us. The princess took my gauntleted hands in her own and knelt down. Tears traced down her beautiful face, streaks of clean lines amidst the caked on dust and sweat. She thanked me and begged for my forgiveness. She blamed her lack of foresight as the reason behind Ganondorf's rise to ultimate power. I shook my head and tried to protest, but she stood up and put a soft finger on my lips to silence me. She said the only thing she could do for me, was to send me back to my own time. Permanently.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The adult princess told me to live my life to the fullest, to experience the full essence of the world...to have a childhood. Zelda took the Ocarina of Time from my belt pouch. As she brought the instrument to her lips, Zelda softly told me to be at peace. As she played the Ocarina, I felt my spirit lift from the ground and I began to soar through time. I arrived back at the Temple of Time, a child once more.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I knew what I had to do. I walked to the Pedestal of Legend one final time, and plunged the Master Sword into the stone with all of my might. Numbed by the realization that this massive adventure was finally, truly over, I trudged through the empty temple, out the imposing entrance, and headed straight to Hyrule Castle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">That was six years ago. Six years of striving for a normal life. But try as I might...I could not. My body was almost fully grown now: I had the musculature of a warrior who had put in countless hours of combat training. I was clad in the attire that Hyrule had come to know: forest green clothing, leather and steel gauntlets, white cotton pants, and tough leather boots. I had never felt that I needed to change my style of clothing. The green Kokiri- spun tunic I wore, albeit modified for an adult's body, was simple, functional, and effective for adventuring through most terrain. The tough material rarely tore and was as sturdy as the trees of the Lost Woods. As I stood there, lost in thought in the garden, brooding over my fate, past deeds, and future life, Zelda, the young princess of Hyrule who was a year or two older than me, interrupted my reverie.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"What are you doing, Link?" she probed, "Did you need to see me?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Oh! Yes!" I jumped, "Sorry, I was daydreaming..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She laughed, "That's fine. It's a common occurrence with you that I've come to adore."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I shifted around, a little embarrassed and unsure of what to say next. I felt my cheeks heat up a little after hearing about her "adorations". After all, she was a princess. And I was...well...a simple 16 year old who preferred adventure, solitude, and battle above all. Still, I could not deny that I was quite attracted to her, despite my self- imposed shortcomings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"So, what is it that you needed to tell me?" she asked with an amused look.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I turned away from her gaze, back toward the Triforce.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I, uhmm, I was going to tell you that I, well..." I paused.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Tell me what?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"That I was leaving Hyrule...I can't stay here. There are just too many painful memories..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Silence stretched between us, heavy as iron. I looked back at her, guilt rising in my chest like a tide. Zelda’s gaze drifted downward, where she noticed the full weight of my gear—my polished Hylian shield and the finely forged sword strapped tight across my back. Her breath caught, and when our eyes met again, there was sadness there first, soft and shining. Then came the flicker of something sharper—hurt, maybe even betrayal—before she turned her face away. I thought I saw a tear glint in the corner of her left eye, catching the light like a fallen star. She sighed, voice catching slightly, then cleared her throat and lifted her chin with royal restraint, but her trembling lashes gave her away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"You're leaving...but...why? I thought you were happy? I thought..." She tore her eyes away from mine. I definitely saw tears now, as one streamed down her face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I thought we were going to be together? And now you're abandoning Hyrule? Abandoning... me?" Her voice quivered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I took her hand in mine. She hesitated. I could feel her almost try to tear it away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"I thought I was going to be happy too... But I can't be. Not after everything I've been through here. All the creatures I've killed and obstacles I've overcome, the friendships created and destroyed. I need..." I sighed, "I need to get away from it, to get far from this place to mend the pain I've been through..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">After what seemed like an hour, Zelda finally spoke in a defeated tone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Well...it truly sounds as if your mind is made up. I cannot stop you, no matter how badly I want to. I know how stubborn you can be..." She peered at me through watery eyes, "You must do what you feel you have to...But please. Before you go, take this..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">She handed me the Ocarina of Time, the sacred royal family heirloom that allowed the user to manipulate time. The sapphire hue glowed faintly in the sunlight, as she placed it into my hand I felt the weight of the ocarina once again. Zelda took my face into her hands and told me to never forget her. To keep her most treasured artifact with me and to always remember who I was and how much I meant to her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I nodded, and felt a tension in my throat as I spoke,"I will never forget you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Suddenly the world shook. I was rocked from my slumber as Epona reared up at an unseen force. I grasped the reins, but they slipped through my fingers. I was launched off her back, and tossed to the ground. Darkness overcame me. When I came to, I heard voices.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Great job you two! You scored a pretty decent catch this time!" A raspy and childlike voice rang out, "Let's see what he's got on him!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I felt a swift kick as the creature rolled me onto my stomach. Hard, skeletal hands probed my belt pouches. I was still too dazed to get on my feet to confront the entity. All I could do was try to snap out of it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Hey Skull Kid! What did ya find?" Another voice chimed in, boyish, along with the faint twinkle that fairies are notorious for. "Lemme see! Lemme SEE!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Shut up, Tael! You'll wake him up!" The third voice, more feminine and light, aside from the abrasive tone anyway.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"He's got a sword, so who knows what he's capable of!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Awwww, but Sis I wanna know!" Tael whined.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The other fairy groaned in annoyance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">"Quiet you guys, look at this thing!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The Skull Kid plucked something from my pouch and began to blow into what sounded like...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">My ocarina! I thought, and shook myself awake!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">While the thief giggled in childish delight, I mustered all the strength I could to stand up. I managed to get to my feet through sheer force of will, balancing precariously as my vision still wobbled. The thief playing my ocarina was a skull kid, just like the ones I'd seen from Kokiri Forest. The creature wore a large straw hat and ragged patchy clothing and his thin, fragile- looking limbs poked out from under the tattered rags. Figuring I was still in the Lost Woods, I prepared to draw my sword and attack the prankster. Yet before I could act, the two fairies, one white and the other purple, saw me and twinkled in alarm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">The skull child stopped playing, and slowly turned to look at me. The thing jumped in surprise and attempted to hide my ocarina behind his back. On his face, he wore a deep purple, heart -shaped mask with colorful spikes that formed the sides. But what stood out most to me were the eyes. Large, round, incredibly disturbing, orange and green eyes that bulged from the mask. I felt them pierce into my mind, until I remembered that he had taken my priceless instrument. A rush of anger flared up and I thought of Zelda. I lunged at the mischievous runt. The thief suddenly leapt high into the air with unprecedented agility, and landed straight onto Epona's saddle! Epona reared up in fright while the skull kid spurred her to move. Stunned only for a second, I threw myself at the now galloping horse, just barely catching hold of the stirrup.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">I clung for dear life, desperately trying to pull myself closer to the insufferable imp! Poor Epona was scared out of her wits—her muscles bunched tight with panic, eyes wide and white-rimmed, every stride a desperate bolt away from the terror on her back. The way she whinnied, sharp and distressed, pierced through my anger and struck something deeper. She trusted me to protect her, and now she was being violated by this masked horror, twisted into a weapon against me. A pang of guilt cut through my fury—I had brought her here, and now she was caught in a nightmare neither of us understood. But even though my anger gave me the strength to hold on, I failed to stop the skull kid. I was being dragged along through sticks, rocks, and thorns that clawed at my skin like angry hands. A jagged stone tore a deep gash along my calf, and every bounce sent sharp shocks of pain up my spine. My tunic snagged and ripped, threads peeling away as the forest carved its punishment into my body. For a fleeting moment, a sliver of fear overtook the anger—a flash of helplessness, of being prey again, dragged through shadow and underbrush by forces I couldn’t yet understand. The two fairies were trying their hardest to keep up, but even they were struggling against Epona’s marvelous speed. The Skull Kid let out shrill peals of laughter, spinning and capering atop the saddle with impossible grace. He danced like a maniacal specter, every motion exaggerated and grotesque, as though the mask fed on chaos. Its surface pulsed faintly with each shriek of laughter, as if drunk on mayhem, growing brighter with every surge of panic and pain around it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Moments later, Epona suddenly leapt over a fallen tree. I couldn't hold on any longer, and my hand went numb. I flew off the saddle, lucky to miss Epona's rear hooves, and I helplessly watched as they galloped away, disappearing into the gloom of the forest...</span>
